<p class="dropcap">A long time ago there lived
a King and a Queen, who
had an only son. As soon
as he was born his mother
gave him to the forester’s
wife to be nursed; for she
herself had to wear her crown all day and
had no time for nursing. The forester’s
wife had just given birth to a little daughter
of her own; but she loved both children
equally and nursed them together like twins.</p>

<p>One night the Queen had a dream that
made the half of her hair turn grey. She
dreamed that she saw the Prince her son at
the age of twenty lying dead with a wound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
over the place of his heart; and near him his
foster-sister was standing, with a royal crown
on her head, and his heart bleeding between
her hands.</p>

<p>The next morning the Queen sent in great
haste for the family Fairy, and told her of
the dream. The Fairy said, “This can
have but one meaning, and it is an evil one.
There is some danger that threatens your
son’s life in his twentieth year, and his
foster-sister is to be the cause of it; also,
it seems she is to make herself Queen. But
leave her to me, and I will avert the evil
chance; for the dream coming beforehand
shows that the Fates mean that he should
be saved.”</p>

<p>The Queen said, “Do anything; only
do not destroy the forester’s wife’s child, for
as yet at least, she has done no wrong. Let
her only be carried away to a safe place
and made secure and treated well. I will
not have my son’s happiness grow out of
another one’s grave.”</p>

<p>The Fairy said, “Nothing is so safe as a
grave when the Fates are awake. Still, I
think I can make everything quite safe
within reason, and leave you a clean as well
as a quiet conscience.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>The little Prince and the forester’s
daughter grew up together till they were a
year old; then, one day, when their nurse
came to look for them, the Prince was found,
but his foster-sister was lost; and though
the search for her was long, she was never
seen again, nor could any trace of her be
found.</p>

<p>The baby Prince pined and pined, and
was so sorrowful over her loss that they
feared for a time that he was going to die.
But his foster-mother, in spite of her grief
over her own child’s disappearance, nursed
him so well and loved him so much that
after a while he recovered his strength.</p>

<p>Then the forester’s wife gave birth to
another daughter, as if to console herself
for the loss of the first. But the same
night that the child was born the Queen
had just the same dream over again. She
dreamed that she saw her son lying dead at
the age of twenty; and there was the wound
in his breast, and the forester’s daughter was
standing by with his heart in her hand and
a royal crown upon her head.</p>

<p>The poor Queen’s hair had gone quite
white when she sent again for the family
Fairy, and told her how the dream had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
repeated itself. The Fairy gave her the
same advice as before, quieting her fears,
and assuring her that however persistent the
Fates might be in threatening the Prince’s
life, all in the end should be well.</p>

<p>Before another year was passed the second
of the forester’s daughters had disappeared;
and the Prince and his foster-mother cried
themselves ill over a loss that had been so
cruelly renewed. The Queen, seeing how
great were the sorrow and the love that the
Prince bore for his foster-sisters, began to
doubt in her heart and say, “What have I
done? Have I saved my son’s life by taking
away his heart?”</p>

<p>Now every year the same thing took
place, the forester’s wife giving birth to a
daughter, and the Queen on the same night
having the same fearful dream of the fate
that threatened her son in his twentieth
year; and afterwards the family Fairy would
come, and then one day the forester’s wife’s
child would disappear, and be heard of no
more.</p>

<p>At last when nine daughters in all had
been born to the forester’s wife and lost to
her when they were but a year old, the
Queen fell very ill. Every day she grew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
weaker and weaker, and the little Prince
came and sat by her, holding her hand and
looking at her with a sorrowful face. At
last one night (it was just a year after the
last of the forester’s children had disappeared)
she woke suddenly, stretching out
her arms and crying. “Oh, Fairy,” she
cried, “the dream, the dream!” And
covering her face with her hands, she died.</p>

<p>The little Prince was now more than ten
years old, and the very saddest of mortals.
He said that there were nine sorrows hidden
in his heart, of which it could not get rid;
and that at night, when all the birds went
home to roost, he heard cries of lamentation
and pain; but whether these came from
very far away, or out of his own heart he
could not tell.</p>

<p>Yet he grew slenderly and well, and had
such grace and tenderness in his nature
that all who saw him loved him. His
foster-mother, when he spoke to her of his
nine sorrows, tried to comfort him, calling
him her own nine joys; and, indeed, he
was all the joy left in life for her.</p>

<p>When the Prince neared his twentieth
year, the King his father felt that he himself
was becoming old and weary of life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
“I shall not live much longer,” he thought:
“very soon my son will be left alone in the
world. It is right, therefore, now that he
should know what is the danger that
threatens his life.” For till then the Prince
had not known anything; all had been
kept a secret between the Queen and the
King and the family Fairy.</p>

<p>The old King knew of the Prince’s nine
sorrows, and often he tried to believe that
they came by chance, and had nothing to
do with the secret that sat at the root of
his son’s life. But now he feared more and
more to tell the Prince the story of those
nine dreams, lest the knowledge should
indeed serve but as the crowning point of
his sorrows, and altogether break his heart
for him.</p>

<p>Yet there was so much danger in leaving
the thing untold that at last he summoned
the Prince to his bedside, meaning to tell
him all. The King had worn himself so
ill with anxiety and grief in thinking over
the matter, that now to tell all was the only
means of saving his life.</p>

<p>The Prince came and knelt down, and
leaned his head on his father’s pillow; and
the King whispered into his ear the story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of the dreams, and of how for his sake all
the Prince’s foster-sisters had been spirited
away.</p>

<p>Before his tale was done he could no
longer bear to look into his son’s face, but
closed his eyes, and, with long silences
between, spoke as one who prayed.</p>

<p>When he had ended he lay quite still,
and the Prince kissed his closed eyelids and
went softly out of the room.</p>

<p>“Now I know,” he said to himself;
“now at last!” And he came through
the wood and knocked at his foster-mother’s
door. “Other mother,” he said
to her, “give me a kiss for each of my
sisters, for now I am going out into the
world to find them, to be rid of the sorrows
in my heart.”</p>

<p>“They can never be found!” she cried,
but she kissed him nine times. “And
this,” she said, “was Monica, and this was
Ponica, and this was Veronica,” and so
she went over every name. “But now
they are only names!” she wept, as she let
him go.</p>

<p>He went along, and he went along, and
he went along. “Where may you be
going to, fair sir?” asked an old peasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
at whose cabin the Prince sought shelter
when night came to the first day of his
wanderings. “Truly,” answered the Prince,
“I do not know how far or whither I need
to go; but I have a finger-post in my heart
that keeps pointing me.”</p>

<p>So that night he stayed there, and the
next day he went on.</p>

<p>“Where to so fast?” asked a wood-cutter
when the second night found him in
the thickest and loneliest parts of the forest.
“Here the night is so dark and the way so
dangerous, one like you should not go
alone.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I know nothing,” said the Prince,
“only I feel like a weather-cock in a wind
that keeps turning me to its will!”</p>

<p>After many days he came to a small
long valley rich in woods and water-courses,
but no road ran through it. More and
more it seemed like the world’s end, a
place unknown, or forgotten of its old
inhabitants. Just at the end of the valley,
where the woods opened into clear slopes
and hollows toward the west, he saw before
him, low and overgrown, the walls of a
little tumble-down grange. “There,” he
said to himself when he saw it, “I can find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
shelter for to-night. Never have I felt
so tired before, or such a pain at my
heart!”</p>

<p>Before long he came to a little gate and
a winding path that led in among lawns
and trees to the door of an old house.
The house seemed as if it had been once
lived in, but there was no sign of any life
about it now. He pushed open the door,
and suddenly there was a sharp rustling of
feathers, and nine white peahens rose up
from the ground and flew out of the
window into the garden.</p>

<p>The Prince searched the whole house
over, and found it a mere ruin; the only
signs of life to be seen were the white
feathers that lifted and blew about over
the floors.</p>

<p>Outside, the garden was gathering itself
together in the dusk, and the peahens were
stepping daintily about the lawns, picking
here and there between the blades of grass.
They seemed to suit the gentle sadness of
the place, which had an air of grief that
has grown at ease with itself.</p>

<p>The Prince went out into the garden,
and walked about among the quietly
stepping birds; but they took no heed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
him. They came picking up their food
between his very feet, as though he were
not there. Silence held all the air, and in
the cleft of the valley the day drooped to
its end.</p>

<p>Just before it grew dark, the nine white
peahens gathered together at the foot of a
great elm, and lifting up their throats they
wailed in chorus. Their lamentable cry
touched the Prince’s heart; “where,” he
asked himself, “have I heard such sorrow
before?” Then all with one accord the
birds sprang rustling up to the lowest
boughs of the elm, and settled themselves
to roost.</p>

<p>The Prince went back to the house, to
find some corner amid its half-ruined rooms
to sleep in. But there the air was close,
and an unpleasant smell of moisture came
from the floor and walls: so, the night
being warm, he returned to the garden, and
folding himself in his cloak lay down under
the tree where the nine peahens were at
roost.</p>

<p>For a long time he tried to sleep, but
could not, there was so much pain and
sorrow in his heart.</p>

<p>Presently when it was close upon midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
over his head one of the birds stirred
and ruffled through all its feathers; and he
heard a soft voice say:</p>

<p>“Sisters, are you awake?”</p>

<p>All the other peahens lifted their heads,
and turned toward the one that spoke, saying,
“Yes, sister, we are awake.”</p>

<p>Then the first one said again, “Our
brother is here.”</p>

<p>They all said, “He is our enemy; it is
for him that we endure this sorrow.”</p>

<p>“To-night,” said the first, “we may all
be free.”</p>

<p>They answered, “Yes, we may all be
free! Who will go down and peck out
his heart? Then we shall be free.”</p>

<p>And the first who had spoken said, “I
will go down!”</p>

<p>“Do not fail, sister!” said all the others.
“For if you fail you can speak to us no
more.”</p>

<p>The first peahen answered, “Do not
fear that I shall fail!” And she began
stepping down the long boughs of the
elm.</p>

<p>The Prince lying below heard all that
was said. “Ah! poor sisters,” he thought,
“have I found you at last; and are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
these sorrows brought upon you for me?”
And he unloosed his doublet, and opened
his vest, making his breast bare for the peahen
to come and peck out his heart.</p>

<p>He lay quite still with his eyes shut, and
when she reached the ground the peahen
found him lying there, as it seemed to her
fast asleep, with his white breast bare for
the stroke of her beak.</p>

<p>Then so fair he looked to her, and so
gentle in his youth, that she had pity on
him, and stood weeping by his side, and
laying her head against his, whispered, “O,
brother, once we lay as babes together and
were nursed at the same breast! How can
I peck out your heart?”</p>

<p>Then she stole softly back into the tree,
and crouched down again by her companions.
They said to her, “Our minute
of midnight is nearly gone. Is there blood
on your beak! Have you our brother’s
heart for us?” But the other answered
never a word.</p>

<p>In the morning the peahens came rustling
down out of the elm, and went searching
for fat carnation buds and anemone seeds
among the flower-beds in the garden. To
the Prince they showed no sign either of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
hatred or fear, but went to and fro carelessly,
pecking at the ground about his feet.
Only one came with drooping head and
wings, and sleeked itself to his caress, and
the Prince, stooping down, whispered in
her ear, “O, sister, why did you not peck
out my heart.”</p>

<p>At night, as before, the peahens all cried
in chorus as they went up into the elm;
and the Prince came and wrapped himself
in his cloak, and lay down at the foot of it
to watch.</p>

<p>At midnight the eight peahens lifted their
heads, and said, “Sister, why did you fail
last night?” But their sister gave them
not a word.</p>

<p>“Alas!” they said, “now she has failed,
unless one of us succeed we shall never
hear her speak with her human voice again.
Why is it that you weep so,” they said
again, “now when deliverance is so near?”
For the poor peahen was shaken with weeping,
and her tears fell down in loud drops
upon the ground.</p>

<p>Then the next sister said, “I will go
down! He is asleep. Be certain, I will
not fail!” So she climbed softly down the
tree, and the Prince opened his shirt and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
laid his breast bare for her to come and
take out his heart.</p>

<p>Presently she stood by his side, and when
she saw him, she too had pity on him for
the youth and kindness of his face. And
once she shut her eyes, and lifted her head
for the stroke; but then weakness seized
her, and she laid her head softly upon his
heart and said, “Once the breast that gave
me milk gave milk also to you. You
were my sister’s brother, and she spared
you: so how can I peck out your heart?”
And having said this she went softly back
into the tree, and crouched down again
among her sisters.</p>

<p>They said to her, “Have you blood
upon your beak? Is his heart ours?” But
she answered them no word.</p>

<p>The next day the two sisters, who because
their hearts betrayed them had become mute,
followed the Prince wherever he went, and
stretched up their heads to his caress. But
the others went and came indifferently,
careless except for food; for until midnight
their human hearts were asleep; only
now the two sisters who had given their
voices away had regained their human hearts
perpetually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>That night the same thing happened as
before. “Sisters,” said the youngest, “to-night
I will go down, since the two eldest
of us have failed. My wrong is fresher in
my heart than theirs! Be sure I shall not
fail!” So the youngest peahen came down
from the tree, and the Prince laid his heart
bare for her beak, but the bird could not find
the will to peck it out. And so it was the
next night, and the next, until eight nights
were gone.</p>

<p>So at last only one peahen was left. At
midnight she raised her head, saying,
“Sisters, are you awake?”</p>

<p>They all turned, and gazed at her weeping,
but could say no word.</p>

<p>Then she said, “You have all failed,
having all tried but me. Now if I fail
we shall remain mute and captive for ever,
more undone by the loss of our last remaining
gift of speech than we were at first.
But I tell you, dear sisters, I will not fail;
for the happiness of you all lies with me
now!”</p>

<p>Then she went softly down the tree;
and one by one they all went following her,
and weeping, to see what the end would be.</p>

<p>They stood some way apart, watching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
with upturned heads, and their poor throats
began catching back a wish to cry as the
little peahen, the last of the sisters, came
and stood by the Prince.</p>

<p>Then she, too, looked in his face, and
saw the white breast made bare for her
beak; and the love of him went deep down
into her heart. And she tried and tried to
shut her eyes and deal the stroke, but could
not.</p>

<p>She trembled and sighed, and turned to
look at her sisters, where they all stood
weeping silently together. “They have
spared him,” she said to herself: “why
should not I?”</p>

<p>But the Prince, seeing that she, too, was
about to fail like the rest of them, turned
and said, as if in his sleep, “Come, come,
little peahen, and peck out my heart!”</p>

<p>At that she turned back again to him,
and laid her head down upon his heart and
cried more sadly than them all.</p>

<p>Then he said, “You have eight sisters,
and a mother who cries for her children to
return!” Yet still she thought he was
dreaming, and speaking only in his sleep.
The other peahens came no nearer, but
stood weeping silently. She looked from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
him to them. “O,” she cried, “I have a
wicked heart, to let one stand in the way of
nine!” Then she threw up her neck and
cried lamentably with her peafowl’s voice,
wishing that the Prince would wake up and
see her, and so escape. And at that all
the other peahens lifted up their heads and
wailed with her: but the Prince never
turned, nor lifted a finger, nor uttered a
sound.</p>

<p>Then she drew in a deep breath, and
closed her eyes fast. “Let my sisters go,
but let me be as I am!” she cried; and with
that she stooped down, and pecked out his
heart.</p>

<p>All her sisters shrieked as their human
shapes returned to them. “O, sister! O,
wicked little sister!” they cried, “What
have you done!”</p>

<p>The little white peahen crouched close
down to the side of the dead Prince. “I
loved him more than you all!” she tried
to say: but she only lifted her head, and
wailed again and again the peafowl’s cry.</p>

<p>The Prince’s heart lay beating at her
feet, so glad to be rid of its nine sorrows
that mere joy made it live on, though all
the rest of the body lay cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>The peahen leaned down upon the
Prince’s breast, and there wailed without
ceasing: till suddenly, piercing with her
beak her own breast, she drew out her own
living heart and laid it in the place where
his had been.</p>

<p>And, as she did so, the wound where she
had pierced him closed and became healed;
and her heart was, as it were, buried in the
Prince’s breast. In her death agony she
could feel it there, her own heart leaping
within his breast for joy.</p>

<p>The Prince, who had seemed to be dead,
flushed from head to foot as the warmth of
life came back to him; with one deep
breath he woke, and found the little white
peahen lying as if dead between his arms.</p>

<p>Then he laughed softly and rose (his
goodness making him wise), and taking up
his own still beating heart he laid it into the
place of hers. At the first beat of it within
her breast, the peahen became transformed
as all her sisters had been, and her own
maiden form came back to her. And the
pain and the wound in her breast grew
healed together, so that she stood up alive
and well in the Prince’s arms.</p>

<p>“Dear heart!” said he: and “Dear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
dear heart!” said she; but whether they
were speaking of their own hearts or of
each other’s, who can tell? for which was
which they themselves did not know.</p>

<p>Then all round was so much embracing
and happiness that it is out of reach for
tongue or pen to describe. For truly the
Prince and his foster-sisters loved each
other dearly, and could put no bounds upon
their present contentment. As for the
Prince and the one who had plucked out
his heart, of no two was the saying ever
more truly told, that they had lost their
hearts to each other; nor was ever love
in the world known before that carried
with it such harmony as theirs.</p>

<p>And so it all came about according to
the Queen’s dream that the forester’s
daughter wore the royal crown upon her
head, and held the Prince’s heart in her
hand.</p>

<p>Long before he died the old King was
made happy because the dream that he had
feared so much had become true: and the
forester’s wife was happy before she died:
and as for the Prince and his wife and his
foster-sisters, they were all rather happy:
and none of them is dead yet.</p>

<h3>THE LUCK OF THE ROSES</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Not far from a great town,
in the midst of a well-wooded
valley, lived a rose-gardener
and his wife. All
round the old home green
sleepy hollows lay girdled
by silver streams, long grasses bent softly
in the wind, and the half fabulous murmur
of woods filled the air.</p>

<p>Up in their rose-garden, on the valley’s
side facing the sun, the gardener and his
wife lived contentedly sharing toil and ease.
They had been young, they were not yet
old; and though they had to be frugal they
did not call themselves poor. A strange
fortune had belonged always to the plot of
ground over which they laboured; whether
because the soil was so rich, or the place so
sheltered from cold, or the gardener so
skilled in the craft, which had come down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
in his family from father to son, could not
be known; but certainly it was true that his
rose-trees gave forth better bloom and bore
earlier and later through the season than
any others that were to be found in those
parts.</p>

<p>The good couple accepted what came to
them, simply and gladly, thanking God.
Perhaps it was from the kindness of fortune,
or perhaps because the sweet perfume of the
roses had mixed itself in their blood, that her
man and his wife were so sweet-tempered
and gentle in their ways. The colour of
the roses was in their faces, and the colour
of the rose was in their hearts; to her man
she was the most beautiful and dearest of
sweethearts, to his wife he was the best and
kindest of lovers.</p>

<p>Every morning, before it was light, her
man and his wife would go into the garden
and gather all the roses that were ripe for
sale; then with full baskets on their backs
they would set out, and get to the market
just as the level sunbeams from the east
were striking all the vanes and spires of the
city into gold. There they would dispose
of their flowers to the florists and salesmen
of the town, and after that trudge home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
again to hoe, and dig, and weed, and water,
and prune, and plant for the rest of the day.
No man ever saw them the one without the
other, and the thought that such a thing
might some day happen was the only fear
and sorrow of their lives.</p>

<p>That they had no children of their own
was scarcely a sorrow to them. “It seems
to me,” said her man after they had been
married for some years, “that God means
that our roses are to be our children since
He has made us love them so much. They
will last when we are grown grey, and will
support and comfort us in our old age.”</p>

<p>All the roses they had were red, and
varied little in kind, yet her man and his
wife had a name for each of them; to every
tree they had given a name, until it almost
seemed that the trees knew, and tried to
answer when they heard the voices which
spoke to them.</p>

<p>“Jane Janet, and you ought to blossom
more freely at your age!” his wife might
say to one some evening as she went round
and watered the flowers; and the next day,
when the two came to their dark morning’s
gathering, Jane Janet would show ten or
twelve great blooms under the light of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
lantern, every one of them the birth of a
single night.</p>

<p>“Mary Maudlin,” the gardener would
say, as he washed the blight off a favourite
rose, “to be sure, you are very beautiful,
but did I not love you so, you were more
trouble than all your sisters put together.”
And then all at once great dew-drops
would come tumbling down out of Mary
Maudlin’s eyes at the tender words of his
reproach. So day by day the companionable
feet of the happy couple moved to and fro,
always intent on the tender nurturing of
their children.</p>

<p>In their garden they had bees too, who
drew all their honey from the roses, and
lived in a cone-thatched hive close under
the porch; and that honey was famous
through all the country-side, for its flavour
was like no other honey made in the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes his wife said to her man, “I
think our garden is looked after for us by
some good Spirit; perhaps it is the Saints
after whom we have named our rose-children.”</p>

<p>Her man made answer, “It is rich in
years, which, like an old wine, have made
it gain in flavour; it has been with us from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
father to son for three hundred years, and
that is a great while.”</p>

<p>“A full fairy’s lifetime!” said his wife.
“’Tis a pity we shall not hand it on, being
childless.”</p>

<p>“When we two die,” said her man, “the
roses will make us a grave and watch over
us.” As he spoke a whole shower of petals
fell from the trees.</p>

<p>“Did no one pass, just then?” said his
wife.</p>

<p>Now one morning, soon after this, in
the late season of roses, her man had gone
before his wife into the garden, gathering
for the market in the grey dusk before
dawn; and wherever he went moths and
beetles came flocking to the light of his
lantern, beating against its horn shutters
and crying to get in. Out of each rose, as
the light fell on it, winged things sprang
up into the darkness; but all the roses were
bowed and heavy as if with grief. As he
picked them from the stem great showers
of dew fell out of them, making pools in
the hollow of his palm.</p>

<p>There was such a sound of tears that he
stopped to listen, and, surely, from all
round the garden came the “drip, drip” of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
falling dew. Yet the pathways under foot
were all dry: there had been no rain and
but little dew. Whence was it, then, that
the roses so shook and sobbed? For under
the stems, surely, there was something that
sobbed; and suddenly the light of the
lantern took hold of a beautiful small figure,
about three feet high, dressed in old rose
and green, that went languidly from flower
to flower. She lifted up such tired hands
to draw their heads down to hers; and to
each one she kissed she made a weary little
sound of farewell, her beautiful face broken
up with grief; and now and then out of
her lips ran soft chuckling laughter, as if
she still meant to be glad, but could not.</p>

<p>The gardener broke into tears to behold
a sight so pitiful; and his wife had
stolen out silently to his side, and was
weeping too.</p>

<p>“Drip, drip” went the roses: wherever
she came and kissed, they all began weeping.
The gardener and his wife knelt
down and watched her; in and out, in
and out, not a rose-blossom did she miss.
She came nearer and nearer, and at last
was standing before them. She seemed
hardly able to draw limb after limb, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
weak was she; and her filmy garments
hung heavy as chains.</p>

<p>A little voice said in their ears, “Kiss
me, I am dying!”</p>

<p>They tasted her breath of rose.</p>

<p>“Do not die!” they said simply.</p>

<p>“I have lived three hundred years,” she
answered. “Now I must die. I am the
Luck of the Roses, but I must leave them
and die.”</p>

<p>“When must you die?” said her man
and his wife.</p>

<p>The little lady said: “Before the last
roses are over; the chills of night take me,
the first frost will kill me. Soon I must
die. Now I must dwindle and dwindle,
for little life is left to me, and only so can
I keep warm. As life and heat grow less,
so must I, till presently I am no more.”</p>

<p>She was a little thing already—not old,
she did not seem old, but delicate as a snowflake,
and so weary. She laid her head in
the hand of the gardener’s wife and sobbed
hard.</p>

<p>“You dear people, who belong so much
to me too, I have watched over you.”</p>

<p>“Let us watch over you!” said they.
They lifted her like a feather-weight, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
carried her into the house. There, in the
ingle-nook, she sat and shivered, while they
brought rose-leaves and piled round her;
but every hour she grew less and less.</p>

<p>Presently the sun shone full upon her
from the doorway: its light went through
her as through coloured glass; and her man
and his wife saw, over the ingle behind her,
shadows fluttering as of falling rose-petals:
it was the dying rose of her life, falling
without end.</p>

<p>All day long she dwindled and grew
more weak and frail. Before sunset she
was smaller than a small child when it first
comes into the world. They set honey
before her to taste, but she was too weary
to uncurl her tiny hands: they lay like
two white petals in the green lap of her
dress. The half-filled panniers of roses
stood where they had been set down in the
porch: the good couple had taken nothing
to the market that day. The luck of the
house lay dying, for all their care; they
could but sit and watch.</p>

<p>When the sun had set, she faded away
fast: now she was as small as a young
wren. The gardener’s wife took her and
held her for warmth in the hollow of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
hand. Presently she seemed no more than
a grasshopper: the tiny chirrup of her
voice was heard, about the middle of the
night, asking them to take her and lay her
among the roses, in the heart of one of the
red roses, that there at last she might die
and pass into nothing.</p>

<p>They went together into the dark night,
and felt their way among the roses; presently
they quite lost her tiny form: she
had slipped away into the heart of a Jane
Janet rose.</p>

<p>The gardener and his wife went back
into the house and sat waiting; they did
not know for what, but they were too sad
at heart to think just then of sleep.</p>

<p>Soon the first greys of morning began to
steal over the world; pale shivers ran across
the sky, and one bird chirped in its sleep
among the trees.</p>

<p>All at once there rang a soft sound of
lamentation among the roses in the rose-garden;
again and again, like the cry of
many gentle wounded things in pain. The
gardener and his wife went and opened the
door: they had to tell the bees of the
fairy’s death. They looked out under
the twilight, into the garden they loved.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
“Drip,” “drip,” “drip” came the sound
of steady weeping under the leaves. Peering
out through the shadows they saw all
the rose-trees rocking themselves softly for
grief.</p>

<p>“Snow?” said his wife to her man.</p>

<p>But it was not snow.</p>

<p>Under the dawn all the roses in the
garden had turned white; for they knew
that the fairy was dead.</p>

<p>The gardener and his wife woke the bees,
and told them of the fairy’s death; then
they looked in each other’s faces, and saw
that they, too, had become white and grey.</p>

<p>With gentle eyes the old couple took
hands, and went down into the garden to
gather white roses for the market.</p>

<h3>THE WHITE KING</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-l.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Long years ago there was
living a Queen who could
not keep count of the
countries over which she
ruled. Her wealth and
her wonderful beauty made
her an apple of discord to all the kings
who lived round about her borders. For
love of her they waged perpetual war upon
one another, and every king who proved
victorious made a gift to the Queen of
the country of the one whom he had conquered,
in the hopes of thereby strengthening
his claim to her favour. Thus it came
about that she could no longer keep count
of the lands which had fallen under her
rule; yet still of all her suitors she chose
none.</p>

<p>Now at this time there was one King,
and only one, who had not succeeded in
losing his heart to the Queen’s majesty, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
spite of her wealth and power, and all her
wonderful beauty. And so, during a long
time, since his fancy was thus free, he was
left in undisturbed peace and prosperity,
while other kings fought out their jealous
battles, and stole away each other’s lands.
And because his reign was so quiet and his
country in such rest, his people, for a pet-name
and for their pride in him, named him
“the White King.”</p>

<p>Now after a time the Queen took it as an
insult that any one should be so indifferent
to the power of her charms, and she began
to threaten him with war for this reason
and for that, wishing thereby to cajole him
into becoming her suitor. But the White
King saw through all the disguises with
which she covered her meaning, and understood
the arrogance of her claim; so one
day he sent to her as a gift a statue of
himself with his sword sheathed, and all his
armour covered over with the cloak of peace.
Round the base of it was written</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When a heart in stone doth move,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then your lover I may prove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But until the marvel’s done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fruitlessly your wars are won.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Queen looked once at the statue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and for a long time after never looked
away; and when at last she did her heart
had been taken captive. Then she looked
at the words beneath, and the red flush
that rose to her face was not gone when
the last of her army passed out of the
city gates to carry war into the country of
the man who had dared thus to speak scorn
of her.</p>

<p>For a whole year the White King fought
with the forces she sent against him; but
when all the other kings came to her aid,
then, stronghold by stronghold, all his cities
were taken, and his lands were laid waste
and their villages burnt, and nothing but
defeat and ruin remained.</p>

<p>Yet in the last battle, when his enemies
thought to have him a safe prisoner, all of
a sudden they found that the White King
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Back came the Queen’s armies in triumph
with their allies, and the conquered territory
was added as one more to the many that
formed her realm. But the Queen sighed
as she looked at the White King’s statue,
and her triumph grew bitter to her. Day
by day, as she looked at the calm marble
face, her love for it increased, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
owned sadly to herself, “He whom I have
conquered has conquered me!”</p>

<p>Of the lost King himself no tidings could
be learned, though search was made far and
wide. Minstrels came to the court, and
sang of his great deeds in fighting against
odds, but of his end they sang variously.
Some sang that he lay buried beneath the
thickest of the slain; others that from his
last battle he had been carried by good
fairies, and that after he had been healed of
his wounds, he would return in a hundred
years and recover his kingdom.</p>

<p>One minstrel came to stay at the court,
who sang of ruined homes and wasted
fields, and a happy land laid desolate, and
how its King wandered friendless and unknown
through the world, hiding himself
in disguise, sometimes in the cottages of
the poor, and sometimes in the dwellings
of the rich. But from no one could the
Queen learn any news that satisfied her, or
gave hope that he would at last bend down
his pride, and come and sue to her for forgiveness.</p>

<p>Wishing to have a hiding place for her
grief, she caused the statue to be set up in
a green glade in the most lonely part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
gardens; and there often she would go and
gaze on the calm noble face (whose closed
eyes seemed even now to disdain her love),
and would wonder how long a queen’s heart
took to break.</p>

<p>But after a time she thought, “Though
I may never win the love of the White
King for my own, is there no way by which
my passion can assuage itself, when by lifting
my finger I can summon half fairyland
to my aid?”</p>

<p>So she called to her the most powerful
Fairy she knew, and taking her into the
green glade, began sighing and weeping in
front of the White King’s statue. “This,”
she said, “is the image of the only man on
earth I can love! But the man himself is
lost, gone I know not where; and my
heart is breaking for grief! Give this
statue a life and a heart, and teach it to
love me, else soon I shall surely be dead!”</p>

<p>The Fairy said to her, “All the might of
fairyland could not do so much; but a
little of it I can do; and if Fate is kind to
you, Fate may bring the rest of it to pass.”</p>

<p>“How much can you do?” asked the
Queen.</p>

<p>“This only,” said the Fairy, “but even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
that you must do for yourself: I can but
show you the way. Stone is stone, and
out of stone I cannot make a heart; but a
heart may grow into it, and this is the way
to compass it.</p>

<p>“You must find first a man who is
loved, but does not love (for if he loves,
the statue’s heart when it wakes will turn
from you); and him you must kill with
your own hand, and take out his heart and
bury it beneath the feet of the statue.
Then I will work my charms, and gradually,
as a flower draws its life out of the ground,
so the statue will draw life out of the
human heart buried below. And after a
little time you will see it move, and in a
little time more its senses will come, and it
will be able to hear, and see, and speak.
But full life will not come to it until it has
learned to love. Then, so soon as it learns
to love, it will become no longer stone, but
a human being.”</p>

<p>But the Queen said, “Supposing its love
were to turn from me to another, where
should I be then?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the Fairy, “the secret will
be your own, and the watching of its life
as it grows will be yours. Your voice it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
will hear, your face it will see; whom,
then, will it learn to love more than
you?”</p>

<p>“Wait, then, till I have found the man,”
said the Queen, “and we will do this thing
between us!”</p>

<p>She searched long among her court for
some man whose heart was whole, but who
was himself loved. Generally, however,
she found it was all the other way. There
was not a man at the court who was not in
love, or did not think himself so; and if
there were one who had no thought of
love, he was too poor and mean for the
love of any woman to be his.</p>

<p>But one day the Queen heard a minstrel
in the palace court-yard singing and making
merry against love. It was that same
minstrel who sang only sad songs of the
White King’s lands laid waste and himself
a wanderer: a fellow with a dark sunburnt
face, and thick hair hanging over his eyes.
And as he sang and rattled his jests at the
courtiers who stood by to listen, the Queen
noticed one of her waiting-women looking
out of a small lattice, who, as she watched
the singer’s face, and listened to his words,
had tears running fast down out of her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Is this a case,” thought the Queen, “of
a man who is loved but who does not love?”</p>

<p>She sent for the minstrel, and said to
him, when he stood bending his head before
her, “Is this pretty scorn that you cast on
love earnest or jest?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” he answered, “I jest in good
earnest; for to speak of love in earnest is
to jest about it.”</p>

<p>“So,” said the Queen, “you are heart-whole?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the minstrel, “I doubt if a
mouse could find its way in; and if I am
heart-whole in your presence, I ought to
be safe from all the world!”</p>

<p>“Now,” thought the Queen, “if only my
waiting-woman answers the test, here is the
heart I will have out!”</p>

<p>Then she bade the minstrel follow her
to where stood the White King’s statue,
bidding him sit down under it and sing her
more of his rhymes about love.</p>

<p>So the minstrel crossed his legs in the
long grass and sang. His song became
bitter to the Queen’s ears, for he took the
words that were round the statue, and
rhymed them and chimed them, and threw
them laughing in the Queen’s face. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
hated him so that she could have poisoned
him; but she remembered that his life was
necessary for her experiment to reach its
end. So she sent instead for a sleepy wine,
which she gave him to drink, and presently
his voice grew thick and his head dropped
down upon his breast, and his legs slid out
and brought him down level with the grass.
When night came on she left him soundly
sleeping with his head between the feet of
the White King’s statue.</p>

<p>Then she sent for the waiting-woman
and said, “Go down to the White King’s
statue, and find for me my handkerchief
which I have dropped there.” But as the
girl went, the Queen stole secretly after her,
and watched her come to where the minstrel
lay asleep.</p>

<p>And when the waiting-maid saw him
lying so, with his face thrown back, she
knelt down in the grass by his side, and
putting her arms softly about him, kissed
him upon the lips over and over again as
though she could never come to an end,
and her tears dropped down on to his face,
and, as if her mind were gone mad for
love of him, the Queen heard her sighing,
“Oh, White King, my White King, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Beloved, whom I love, but who loves me
not!”</p>

<p>As soon as the waiting-maid was gone, the
Queen came softly to the place, and with a
sharp knife she cut out the minstrel’s heart
and buried it at the base of the statue.</p>

<p>In the morning the minstrel was found
lying dead, with his heart gone; and when
they washed the dead face and put back the
hair that covered the eyes, they found that
it was the White King himself.</p>

<p>That day, and for many days after, there
were two women weeping in the palace:
one was the Queen and the other was the
waiting-woman. But the body of the White
King they buried close by the statue in the
green glade.</p>

<p>Now presently, when the first violence of
her grief was over, the Queen came to look
at the place; and, sure enough, the Fairy
had been there with her spells. When the
wind blew the statue swayed gently like a
tree in the wind.</p>

<p>The Queen caused gates and barriers to
be put up so that no one should enter the
glade but herself; only Love found a way,
and at night, when all the world was asleep,
the waiting-woman crept through a loose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
pale in the barriers, and came to moan over
the place where her lover had been slain.</p>

<p>All night she would lie with her arms
round the feet of the White King’s statue,
and dream of the dead minstrel whom she
had loved and known through all his disguise.
And all night long her lips would
murmur his name, and whisper over and
over again the sad story of her love.</p>

<p>And presently, as the statue drew life
from the heart buried beneath its feet, its
ears were opened and it heard.</p>

<p>In the daytime the Queen would come
and sit before it and whisper to it of love,
offering it all the gifts of riches and power
that are in the hands of kings to give; but
at night came the waiting-woman and offered
it only love.</p>

<p>Out of the ground the Queen saw grow
a small plant, that began to creep upwards
and to wind itself round the base of the
statue; and when she saw that its flower
was the deadly nightshade, her heart trembled
and her conscience made her afraid.</p>

<p>But the waiting-maid, when she saw it,
picked the sad blossoms and made a crown
for the statue’s head as of pale amethyst
and gold: for she said to herself, “Down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
below my dear lies dead, and the roots of
this flower are in his hair.”</p>

<p>One day as the Queen came into the
glade, she heard the dead minstrel’s voice,
and her heart shook with terror as she saw
the statue open its white lips and sing, and
recognised the tune and the words as those
which had made her heart feel so bitter
against him; for she thought, “What if he
knows that it is I who have slain him?”</p>

<p>Now that she saw that the stone had its
five senses, and could see and speak and
hear, she pleaded to it all day out of the
greatness of her grief and her love. But
the statue never returned her word.</p>

<p>At night, lying with her face bowed
between the White King’s statue’s feet, the
waiting-woman knew nothing of all this
change; only the statue heard and saw and
knew. And at last one day as her tears
dropped on them, she felt the feet grow
warm between her hands; and a voice over
her head that she remembered and loved,
said, “Little heart, why are you weeping
so?”</p>

<p>In the morning the Queen came and
found the statue gone. There on the
pedestal was only the print of his feet, half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
covered by the deadly nightshade which
had climbed up to his knees and fallen.
There it lay heavy and half-withered, clasping
the hollows where his feet had been.</p>

<p>The Queen knelt down and caught the
bare stone pedestal in her arms. “Oh, Love,”
she cried, “have you left me? Oh, White
King, my White King, have you betrayed
me?” And as she clung there weeping, her
lips touched the deadly nightshade; and the
nightshade thrilled, and felt joy give new
life down into its roots.</p>

<p>It reached up and laid its arms about the
Queen, about her throat, and about her feet
and about her waist. “Dearly, dearly we
love each other,” said the nightshade, “do
we not?”</p>

<p>At night the courtiers came, and found
only a dead Queen lying, and the statue
gone.</p>

<p>But the White King had gone home to
his own land to marry the waiting-woman.</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE HERONS</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A long time ago there lived
a King and a Queen who
loved each other dearly.
They had both fallen in
love at first sight; and as
their love began so it went
on through all their life. Yet this, which
was the cause of all their happiness, was the
cause also of all their misfortunes.</p>

<p>In his youth, when he was a beautiful
young bachelor, the King had had the ill-luck
to attract the heart of a jealous and
powerful Fairy; and though he never gave
her the least hope or encouragement, when
she heard that his love had been won at
first sight by a mere mortal, her rage and
resentment knew no bounds. She said
nothing, however, but bided her time.</p>

<p>After they had been married a year the
Queen presented her husband with a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
daughter; before she was yet a day old she
was the most beautiful object in the world,
and life seemed to promise her nothing but
fortune and happiness.</p>

<p>The family Fairy came to the blessing of
the new-born; and she, looking at it as it
lay beautifully asleep in its cradle, and
seeing that it had already as much beauty
and health as the heart could desire, promised
it love as the next best gift it was
within her power to offer. The Queen, who
knew how much happiness her own love
had brought her, was kissing the good Fairy
with all the warmth of gratitude, when a
black kite came and perched upon the
window-sill crying: “And I will give her
love at first sight! The first living thing
that she sets eyes on she shall love to distraction,
whether it be man or monster,
prince or pauper, bird, beast or reptile.”
And as the wicked Fairy spoke she clapped
her wings, and up through the boards of
the floor, and out from under the bed, and
in through the window, came a crowd of all
the ugliest shapes in the world. Thick and
fast they came, gathering about the cradle
and lifting their heads over the edge of it,
waiting for the poor little Princess to wake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
up and fall in love at first sight with one
of them.</p>

<p>Luckily the child was asleep; and the
good Fairy, after driving away the black
kite and the crowd of beasts it had called
to its aid, wrapped the Princess up in a
shawl and carried her away to a dark
room where no glimmer of light could
get in.</p>

<p>She said to the Queen: “Till I can devise
a better way, you must keep her in the dark;
and when you take her into the open air
you must blindfold her eyes. Some day,
when she is of a fit age, I will bring a
handsome Prince for her; and only to him
shall you unblindfold her at last, and make
love safe for her.”</p>

<p>She went, leaving the King and Queen
deeply stricken with grief over the harm
which had befallen their daughter. They
did not dare to present even themselves
before her eyes lest love for them, fatal and
consuming, should drive her to distraction.
In utter darkness the Queen would sit and
cherish her daughter, clasping her to her
breast, and calling her by all sweet names;
but the little face, except by stealth when it
was sound asleep, she never dared to see,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
nor did the baby-Princess know the face of
the mother who loved her.</p>

<p>By and by, however, the family Fairy
came again, saying: “Now, I have a plan
by which your child may enjoy the delights
of seeing, and no ill come of it.” And she
caused to be made a large chamber, the
whole of one side of which was a mirror.
High up in the opposite wall were windows
so screened that from below no one could
look out of them, but across on to the
mirror came all the sweet sights of the
world, glimpses of wood and field, and the
sun and the moon and the stars, and of
every bird as it flew by. So the little
Princess was brought and set in a screened
place looking towards the mirror, and there
her eyes learned gradually all the beautiful
things of the world. Over the screen, in
the glass before her, she learned to know
her mother’s face, and to love it dearly in
a gentle child-like fashion; and when she
could talk she became very wise, understanding
all that was told her about the
danger of looking at anything alive, except
by its reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>When she went out into the open air for
her health, she always wore a bandage over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
her eyes, lest she should look, and love
something too well: but in the chamber of
the mirror her eyes were free to see whatever
they could. The good Fairy, making
herself invisible, came and taught her to
read and make music, and draw; so that
before she was fifteen she was the most
charming and accomplished, as well as the
most beautiful Princess of her day.</p>

<p>At last the Fairy said that the time was
come for her world of reflections to be
made real, and she went away to fetch the
ideal Prince that the Princess might at first
sight fall in love with him.</p>

<p>The very day after she was gone, as the
morning was fine, the Princess went out
with one of her maids for a walk through
the woods. Over her patient eyes she
wore a bandage of green silk, through
which she felt the sunlight fall pleasantly.</p>

<p>Out of doors the Princess knew most
things by their sounds. She passed under
rustling leaves, and along by the side of
running water; and at last she heard the
silence of the water, and knew that she was
standing by the great fish-pond in the
middle of the wood. Then she said to her
waiting-woman, “Is there not some great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
bird fishing out there, for I hear the
dipping of his bill, and the water falling off
it as he draws out the fish?”</p>

<p>And just as she was saying that, the
wicked Fairy, who had long bided her time,
coming softly up from behind, pushed the
waiting-woman off the bank into the deep
water of the pond. Then she snatched away
the silk bandage, and before the Princess
had time to think or close her eyes, she had
lost her heart to a great heron, that was
standing half-way up to his feathers fishing
among the reeds.</p>

<p>The Princess, with her eyes set free,
laughed for joy at the sight of him. She
stretched out her arms from the bank and
cried most musically for the bird to come
to her; and he came in grave stately
fashion, with trailing legs, and slow sobbing
creak of his wings, and settled down on the
bank beside her. She drew his slender
neck against her white throat, and laughed
and cried with her arms round him, loving
him so that she forgot all in the world
beside. And the heron looked gravely at
her with kind eyes, and, bird-like, gave her
all the love he could, but not more; and
so, presently, casting his grey wings abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
lifted himself and sailed slowly back to his
fishing among the reeds.</p>

<p>The waiting-woman had got herself out
of the water, and stood wringing her
clothes and her hands beside the Princess.
“O, sweet mistress,” she cried, with lamentation,
“now is all the evil come about
which it was our whole aim to avoid! And
what, and what will the Queen your
mother say?”</p>

<p>But the Princess answered, smiling,
“Foolish girl, I had no thought of what
happiness meant till now! See you where
my love is gone? and did you notice the
bend of his neck, and the exceeding length
of his legs, and the stretch of his grey
wings as he flew? This pond is his hall of
mirrors, wherein he sees the reflection of
all his world. Surely I, from my hall of
mirrors, am the true mate for him!”</p>

<p>Her maid, seeing how far the evil had
gone, and that no worse could now happen,
ran back to the palace and curdled all the
court’s blood with her news. The King
and the Queen and all their nobility rushed
down, and there they found the Princess
with the heron once more in her arms,
kissing and fondling it with all the marks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of a sweet and maidenly passion. “Dear
mother,” she said, as soon as she saw the
Queen, “the happiness, which you feared
would be sorrow, has come; and it is such
happiness I have no name for it! And the
evil that you so dreaded, see how sweet it
is! And how sweet it is to see all the
world with my own eyes and you also at
last!” And for the first time in her life she
kissed her mother’s face in the full light
of day.</p>

<p>But her mother hung sobbing upon her
neck, “O, my darling, my beautiful,” she
wept, “does your heart belong for ever to
this grey bird?”</p>

<p>Her daughter answered, “He is more
than all the world to me! Is he not goodly
to look upon? Have you considered the
bend of his neck, the length of his legs, and
the waving of his wings; his skill also when
he fishes: what imagination, what presence
of mind!”</p>

<p>“Alas, alas,” sorrowed the Queen, “dear
daughter, is this all true to you?”</p>

<p>“Mother,” cried the Princess, clinging
to her with entreaty, “is all the world blind
but me?”</p>

<p>The heron had become quite fond of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Princess; wherever she went it followed
her, and, indeed, without it nowhere would
she go. Whenever it was near her, the
Princess laughed and sang, and when it was
out of her sight she became sad as night.
All the courtiers wept to see her in such
bondage. “Ah,” said she, “your eyes have
been worn out with looking at things so
long; mine have been kept for me in a
mirror.”</p>

<p>When the good family Fairy came (for
she was at once sent for by the Queen, and
told of all that had happened), she said,
“Dear Madam, there are but two things
you can do: either you can wring the
heron’s neck, and leave the Princess to die
of grief; or you can make the Princess
happy in her own way, by——” Her voice
dropped, and she looked from the King to
the Queen before she went on. “At her
birth I gave your daughter love for my
gift; now it is hers, will you let her keep
it?”</p>

<p>The King and the Queen looked softly
at each other. “Do not take love from
her,” said they, “let her keep it!”</p>

<p>“There is but one way,” answered the
Fairy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“Do not tell me the way,” said the Queen
weeping, “only let the way be!”</p>

<p>So they went with the Fairy down to the
great pond, and there sat the Princess, with
the grey heron against her heart. She
smiled as she saw them come. “I see good
in your hearts toward me!” she cried.
“Dear godmother, give me the thing that
I want, that my love may be happy!”</p>

<p>Then the Fairy stroked her but once
with her wand, and two grey herons suddenly
rose up from the bank, and sailed
away to a hiding-place in the reeds.</p>

<p>The Fairy said to the Queen, “You have
made your daughter happy; and still she
will have her voice and her human heart,
and will remember you with love and gratitude;
but her greatest love will be to the
grey heron, and her home among the reeds.”</p>

<p>So the changed life of the Princess began;
every day her mother went down to the
pool and called, and the Princess came
rising up out of the reeds, and folded her
grey wings over her mother’s heart. Every
day her mother said, “Daughter of mine,
are you happy?”</p>

<p>And the Princess answered her, “Yes,
for I love and am loved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Yet each time the mother heard more
and more of a note of sadness come into
her daughter’s voice; and at last one day
she said, “Answer me truly, as the mother
who brought you into the world, whether
you be happy in your heart of hearts or no?”</p>

<p>Then the heron-Princess laid her head
on the Queen’s heart, and said, “Mother,
my heart is breaking with love!”</p>

<p>“For whom, then?” asked the Queen
astonished.</p>

<p>“For my grey heron, whom I love, and
who loves me so much. And yet it is love
that divides us, for I am still troubled with
a human heart, and often it aches with
sorrow because all the love in it can never
be fully understood or shared by my heron;
and I have my human voice left, and that
gives me a hundred things to say all day,
for which there is no word in herons’
language, and so he cannot understand them.
Therefore these things only make a gulf
between him and me. For all the other
grey herons in the pools there is happiness,
but not for me who have too big a heart
between my wings.”</p>

<p>Her mother said softly, “Wait, wait,
little heron-daughter, and it shall be well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
with you!” Then she went to the Fairy
and said, “My daughter’s heart is lonely
among the reeds, for the grey heron’s love
covers but half of it. Give her some companions
of her own kind that her hours
may become merry again!”</p>

<p>So the Fairy took and turned five of the
Princess’s lady’s-maids into herons, and sent
them down to the pool.</p>

<p>The five herons stood each on one leg in
the shallows of the pool, and cried all day
long; and their tears fell down into the
water and frightened away the fish that
came their way. For they had human
hearts that cried out to be let go. “O,
cruel, cruel,” they wept, whenever the
heron-Princess approached, “see what we
suffer because of you, and what they have
made of us for your sake!”</p>

<p>The Princess came to her mother and
said, “Dear mother, take them away, for
their cry wearies me, and the pool is bitter
with their tears! They only awake the
human part of my heart that wants to
sleep; presently, may be, if it is let alone,
it will forget itself.”</p>

<p>Her mother said, “It is my coming
every day also that keeps it awake.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Princess answered, “This sorrow belongs to
my birthright; you must still come; but for
the others, let the Fairy take them away.”</p>

<p>So the Fairy came and released the five
lady’s-maids whom she had changed into
herons. And they came up out of the
water, stripping themselves of their grey
feather-skins and throwing them back into
the pool. The Fairy said, “You foolish
maids, you have thrown away a gift that
you should have valued; these skins you
could have kept and held as heirlooms in
your family.”</p>

<p>The five maids answered, “We want to
forget that there are such things as herons
in the world!”</p>

<p>After much thought the Queen said to
the Fairy, “You have changed a Princess
into a heron, and five maids into herons and
back again; cannot you change one heron
into a Prince?” But the Fairy answered
sadly, “Our power has limits; we can
bring down, but we cannot bring up, if
there be no heart to answer our call. The
five maids only followed their hearts, that
were human, when I called them back; but
a heron has only a heron’s heart, and unless
his heart become too great for a bird and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
he earn a human one, I cannot change him
to a higher form.” “How can he earn a
human one?” asked the Queen. “Only
if he love the Princess so well that his love
for her becomes stronger than his life,” answered
the Fairy. “Then he will have
earned a human body, and then I can give
him the form that his heart suits best.
There may be a chance, if we wait for it and
are patient, for the Princess’s love is great
and may work miracles.”</p>

<p>A little while after this, the Queen
watching, saw that the two herons were
making a nest among the reeds. “What
have you there?” said the mother to
her daughter. “A little hollow place,”
answered the heron-Princess, “and in it the
moon lies.” A little while after she said
again, “What have you there, now, little
daughter?” And her daughter answered,
“Only a small hollow space; but in it two
moons lie.”</p>

<p>The Queen told the family Fairy how
in a hollow of the reeds lay two moons.
“Now,” said the Fairy, “we will wait no
longer. If your daughter’s love has touched
the heron’s heart and made it grow larger
than a bird’s, I can help them both to happiness;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
but if not, then birds they must
still remain.”</p>

<p>Among the reeds the heron said in bird
language to his wife, “Go and stretch your
wings for a little while over the water; it is
weary work to wait here so long in the
reeds.” The heron-Princess looked at him
with her bird’s eyes, and all the human love
in her heart strove, like a fountain that
could not get free, to make itself known
through them; also her tongue was full of
the longing to utter sweet words, but she
kept them back, knowing they were beyond
the heron’s power to understand. So she
answered merely in heron’s language, “Come
with me, and I will come!”</p>

<p>They rose, wing beating beside wing;
and the reflection of their grey breasts slid
out under them over the mirror of the pool.</p>

<p>Higher they went and higher, passing
over the tree tops, and keeping time together
as they flew. All at once the wings
of the grey heron flagged, then took a deep
beat; he cried to the heron-Princess, “Turn,
and come home, yonder there is danger
flying to meet us!” Before them hung a
brown blot in the air, that winged and grew
large. The two herons turned and flew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
back. “Rise,” cried the grey heron, “we
must rise!” and the Princess knew what
was behind, and struggled with the whole
strength of her wings for escape.</p>

<p>The grey heron was bearing ahead on
stronger wing. “With me, with me!”
he cried. “If it gets above us, one of us is
dead!” But the falcon had fixed his eye on
the Princess for his quarry, and flew she
fast, or flew she slow, there was little
chance for her now. Up and up she
strained, but still she was behind her mate,
and still the falcon gained.</p>

<p>The heron swung back to her side; she
saw the anguish and fear of his downward
glance as his head ranged by hers. Past
her the falcon went, towering for the final
swoop.</p>

<p>The Princess cried in heron’s language,
“Farewell, dear mate, and farewell, two
little moons among the reeds!” But the
grey heron only kept closer to her side.</p>

<p>Overhead the falcon closed in its wings
and fell like a dead weight out of the clouds.
“Drop!” cried the grey heron to his mate.</p>

<p>At his word she dropped; but he stayed,
stretching up his wings, and, passing between
the descending falcon and its prey, caught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
in his own body the death-blow from its
beak. Drops of his blood fell upon the
heron-Princess.</p>

<p>He stricken in body, she in soul, together
they fell down to the margin of the pool.
The falcon still clung fleshing its beak in
the neck of its prey. The heron-Princess
threw back her head, and, darting furiously,
struck her own sharp bill deep into the
falcon’s breast. The bird threw out its
wings with a hoarse cry and fell back dead,
with a little tuft of the grey heron’s feathers
still upon its beak.</p>

<p>The heron-Princess crouched down, and
covered with her wings the dying form of
her mate; in her sorrow she spoke to him
in her own tongue, forgetting her bird’s
language. The grey heron lifted his head,
and, gazing tenderly, answered her with a
human voice:</p>

<p>“Dear wife,” he said, “at last I have the
happiness so long denied to me of giving
utterance in the speech that is your own to
the love that you have put into my heart.
Often I have heard you speak and have not
understood; now something has touched
my heart, and changed it, so that I can both
speak and understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“O, beloved!” She laid her head down
by his. “The ends of the world belong to
us now. Lie down, and die gently by my
side, and I will die with you, breaking my
heart with happiness.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the grey heron, “do not
die yet! Remember the two little moons
that lie in the hollow among the reeds.”
Then he laid his head down by hers, being
too weak to say more.</p>

<p>They folded their wings over each other,
and closed their eyes; nor did they know
that the Fairy was standing by them, till
she stroked them both softly with her wand,
saying to each of them the same words:</p>

<p>“Human heart, and human form, come
out of the grey heron!”</p>

<p>And out of the grey heron-skins came
two human forms; the one was the Princess
restored again to her own shape, but the
other was a beautiful youth, with a bird-like
look about the eyes, and long slender
limbs. The Princess, as she gazed on him,
found hardly any change, for love remained
the same, binding him close to her heart;
and, grey heron or beautiful youth, he was
all one to her now.</p>

<p>Then came the Queen, weeping for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
joy, and embracing them both, and after
them, the Fairy. “O, how good an ending,”
she cried, “has come to that terrible dream!
Let it never be remembered or mentioned
between us more!” And she began to lead
the way back to the palace.</p>

<p>But the youth, to whom the Fairy gave
the name of Prince Heron, turned and took
up the two heron-skins which he and his
wife had let fall, and followed, carrying
them upon his arm. And as they came
past the bed of reeds, the Princess went
aside, and, stooping down in a certain place
drew out from thence something which she
came carrying, softly wrapped in the folds
of her gown.</p>

<p>With what rejoicing the Princess and
her husband were welcomed by the King
and all the Court needs not to be told.
For a whole month the festivities continued;
and whenever she showed herself,
there was the Princess sitting with two
eggs in her lap, and her hands over
them to keep them warm. The King was
impatient. “Why cannot you send them
down to the poultry yard to be hatched?”
he said.</p>

<p>But the Princess replied smiling, “My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
moons are my own, and I will keep them
to myself.”</p>

<p>“Do you hear?” she said one day, at
last; and everybody who listened could
hear something going “tap, tap,” inside the
shells. Presently the eggs cracked, and out
of each, at the same moment, came a little
grey heron.</p>

<p>When she saw that they were herons,
the Queen wrung her hands. “O, Fairy,”
she cried, “what a disappointment is this!
I had hoped two beautiful babies would
have come out of those shells.”</p>

<p>But the Fairy said, “It is no matter.
Half of their hearts are human already;
birds’ hearts do not beat so. If you wish
it, I can change them.” So she stroked
them softly with her wand, saying to each,
“Human heart, and human form, come out
of the grey heron!”</p>

<p>Yet she had to stroke them three times
before they would turn; and she said to
the Princess, “My dear, you were too
satisfied with your lot when you laid these
eggs. I doubt if more than a quarter of
them is human.”</p>

<p>“I was very satisfied,” said the Princess,
and she laughed across to her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>At last, however, on the third stroke of
the wand, the heron’s skins dropped off,
and they changed into a pair of very small
babies, a boy and a girl. But the difference
between them and other children was,
that instead of hair, their heads were
covered with a fluff of downy grey feathers;
also they had queer, round, bird-like eyes,
and were able to sleep standing.</p>

<p>Now, after this the happiness of the
Princess was great; but the Fairy said to
her, “Do not let your husband see the
heron-skins again for some while, lest with
the memory a longing for his old life
should return to him and take him away
from you. Only by exchange with another
can he ever get back his human form again,
if he surrenders it of his own free will.
And who is there so poor that he would
willingly give up his human form to
become a bird?”</p>

<p>So the Princess took the four coats of
feather—her own and her husband’s and
her two children’s—and hid them away in
a closet of which she alone kept the key.
It was a little gold key, and to make it
safe she hung it about her neck, and wore
it night and day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>The Prince said to her, “What is that
little key that you wear always hung round
your neck?”</p>

<p>She answered him, “It is the key to
your happiness and mine. Do not ask
more than that!” At that there was a
look in his face that made her say, “You
<i>are</i> happy, are you not?”</p>

<p>He kissed her, saying, “Happy indeed!
Have I not you to make me so?” Yet
though, indeed, he told no untruth, and
was happy whenever she was with him,
there were times when a restlessness and a
longing for wings took hold of him; for,
as yet, the life of a man was new and half
strange to him, and a taint of his old life
still mixed itself with his blood. But to
her he was ashamed to say what might seem
a complaint against his great fortune; so
when she said “happiness,” he thought, “Is
it just the turning of that key that I want
before my happiness can be perfect?”</p>

<p>Therefore, one night when the early
season of spring made his longing strong
in him, he took the key from the Princess
while she slept, and opened the little closet
in which hung the four feather coats. And
when he saw his own, all at once he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the great pools of water, and
how they lay in the shine and shadow of
the moonlight, while the fish rose in rings
upon their surface. And at that so great a
longing came into him to revisit his old
haunts that he reached out his hand and
took down the heron-skin from its nail and
put it over himself; so that immediately his
old life took hold of him, and he flew out
of the window in the form of a grey heron.</p>

<p>In the morning the Princess found the
key gone from her neck, and her husband’s
place empty. She went in haste to the
closet, and there stood the door wide with
the key in it, and only three heron-skins
hanging where four had used to be.</p>

<p>Then she came crying to the family
Fairy, “My husband has taken his heron-skin
and is gone! Tell me what I can do!”</p>

<p>The Fairy pitied her with all her heart,
but could do nothing. “Only by exchange,”
said she, “can he get back his
human shape; and who is there so poor
that he would willingly lose his own form
to become a bird? Only your children,
who are but half human, can put their
heron-skins on and off as they like and
when they like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>In deep grief the Princess went to look
for her husband down by the pools in the
wood. But now his shame and sorrow at
having deceived her were so great that as
soon as he heard her voice he hid himself
among the reeds, for he knew now that,
having put on his heron-skin again, he
could not take it off unless some one gave
him a human form in exchange.</p>

<p>At last, however, so pitiful was the cry
of the Princess for him, that he could bear
to hear it no more; but rising up from
the reeds came trailing to her sadly over
the water. “Ah, dear love!” she said
when he was come to her, “if I had not distrusted
you, you would not have deceived
me: thus, for my fault we are punished.”
So she sorrowed, and he answered her:</p>

<p>“Nay, dear love, for if I had not deceived
you, you would not have distrusted me. I
thought I was not happy, yet I feared to
tell it you.” Thus they sorrowed together,
both laying on themselves the blame and
the burden.</p>

<p>Then she said to him: “Be here for me
to-night, for now I must go; but then I
shall return.”</p>

<p>She went back to the palace, and told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
her mother of all that had happened.
“And now,” she said, “you who know
where my happiness lies will not forbid me
from following it; for my heart is again
with the grey heron.” And the Queen
wept, but would not say her no.</p>

<p>So that night the Princess went and
kissed her children as they slept standing
up in their beds, with their funny feather-pates
to one side; and then she took down
her skin of feathers and put it on, and
became changed once more into a grey
heron. And again she went up to the two
in their cots, and kissed their birdish heads
saying: “They who can change at will, being
but half human, they will come and visit
us in the great pool by the wood, and bring
back word of us here.”</p>

<p>In the morning the Princess was gone,
and the two children when they woke
looked at each other and said: “Did we
dream last night?”</p>

<p>They both answered each other “Yes,
first we dreamed that our mother came and
kissed us; and we liked that. And then
we dreamed that a grey heron came and
kissed us, and we liked that better still!”
They waved their arms up and down.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
“Why have we not wings?” they kept
asking. All day long they did this, playing
that they were birds. If a window
were opened, it was with the greatest difficulty
that they were kept from trying to
fly through.</p>

<p>In the Court they were known as the
“Feather-pates”; nothing could they be
taught at all. When they were rebuked
they would stand on one leg and sigh with
their heads on one side; but no one ever
saw tears come out of their birdish eyes.</p>

<p>Now at night they would dream that
two grey herons came and stood by their
bedsides, kissing them; “And where in the
world,” they said when they woke, “<i>are</i>
our wings?”</p>

<p>One day, wandering about in the palace,
they came upon the closet in which hung
the two little feather coats. “O!!!”
they cried, and opened hard bright eyes at
each other, nodding, for now they knew
what they would do. “If we told, they
would be taken off us,” they said; and
they waited till it was night. Then they
crept back and took the two little coats
from their pegs, and, putting them on, were
turned into two young herons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Through the window they flew, away
down to the great fish-pond in the wood.
Their father and mother saw them coming,
and clapped their wings for joy. “See,”
they said, “our children come to visit us,
and our hearts are left to us to love with.
What further happiness can we want?”
But when they were not looking at each
other they sighed.</p>

<p>All night long the two young herons
stayed with their parents; they bathed, and
fished, and flew, till they were weary. Then
the Princess showed them the nest among
the reeds, and told them all the story of
their lives.</p>

<p>“But it is much nicer to be herons than
to be real people,” said the young ones,
sadly, and became very sorrowful when
dawn drew on, and their mother told them
to go back to the palace and hang up the
feather coats again, and be as they had been
the day before.</p>

<p>Long, long the day now seemed to them;
they hardly waited till it was night before
they took down their feather-skins, and,
putting them on, flew out and away to the
fish-pond in the wood.</p>

<p>So every night they went, when all in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
palace were asleep; and in the morning
came back before anyone was astir, and
were found by their nurses lying demurely
between the sheets, just as they had been
left the night before.</p>

<p>One day the Queen when she went to see
her daughter said to her, “My child, your
two children are growing less like human
beings and more like birds every day.
Nothing will they learn or do, but stand
all day flapping their arms up and down,
and saying, ‘Where are our wings, where
are our wings?’ The idea of one of them
ever coming to the throne makes your
father’s hair stand on end under his
crown.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother,” said the heron-Princess,
“I have made a sad bed for you and my
father to lie on!”</p>

<p>One day the two children said to each
other, “Our father and mother are sad,
because they want to be real persons again,
instead of having wings and catching fish
the way we like to do. Let us give up
being real persons, which is all so much
trouble, and such a want of exercise, and
make them exchange with us!” But when
the two young herons went down to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
pond and proposed it to them, their parents
said, “You are young; you do not know
what you would be giving up.” Nor would
they consent to it at all.</p>

<p>Now one morning it happened that the
Feather-pates were so late in returning to
the palace that the Queen, coming into
their chamber, found the two beds empty;
and just as she had turned away to search
for them elsewhere, she heard a noise of
wings and saw the two young herons come
flying in through the window. Then she
saw them take off their feather-skins and
hang them up in the closet, and after that
go and lie down in their beds so as to look
as if they had been there all night.</p>

<p>The Queen struck her hands together
with horror at the sight, but she crept away
softly, so that they did not know they had
been found out. But as soon as they were
out of their beds and at play in another
part of the palace, the Queen went to the
closet, and setting fire to the two heron-skins
where they hung, burnt them till not
a feather of them was left, and only a heap
of grey ashes remained to tell what had
become of them.</p>

<p>At night, when the Feather-pates went to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
their cupboards and found their skins gone,
and saw what had become of them, their
grief knew no bounds. They trembled
with fear and rage, and tears rained out of
their eyes as they beheld themselves deprived
of their bird bodies and made into
real persons for good and all.</p>

<p>“We won’t be real persons!” they
cried. But for all their crying they knew no
way out of it. They made themselves
quite ill with grief; and that night, for the
first time since they had found their way to
the closet, they stayed where their nurses
had put them, and did not even stand up in
their beds to go to sleep. There they lay
with gasping mouth, and big bird-like eyes
all languid with grief, and hollow grey
cheeks.</p>

<p>Presently their father and mother came
seeking for them, wondering why they had
not come down to the fish-pond as they
were wont. “Where are you, my children?”
cried the heron-Princess, putting her
head in through the window.</p>

<p>“Here we are, both at death’s door!”
they cried. “Come and see us die! Our
wicked granddam has burnt our feather-skins
and made us into real persons for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
ever and ever, Amen. But we will die
rather!”</p>

<p>The parent herons, when they heard
that, flew in through the window and bent
down over the little ones’ beds.</p>

<p>The two children reached up their arms.
“Give us your feathers!” they cried.
“We shall die if you don’t! We <i>will</i>
die if you don’t! O, do!” But still the
parent birds hesitated, nor knew what to
do.</p>

<p>“Bend down, and let me whisper something!”
said the boy to his father: and
“Bend down, and whisper!” cried the girl
to her mother. And father and mother
bent down over the faces of their sick children.
Then these, both together, caught
hold of them, and crying, “Human heart,
and human form, exchange with the grey
heron!” pulled off their parents’ feather-skins,
and put them upon themselves.</p>

<p>And there once more stood Prince Heron
and the Princess in human shape, while the
two children had turned into herons in their
place.</p>

<p>The young herons laughed and shouted
and clapped their wings for joy. “Are you
not happy now?” cried they. And when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
their parents saw the joy, not only in their
children’s eyes, but in each other’s, and felt
their hearts growing glad in the bodies they
had regained, then they owned that the
Feather-pates had been wise in their generation,
and done well according to their
lights.</p>

<p>So it came about that the Prince and the
Princess lived happily ever after, and the
two young herons lived happily also, and
were the best-hearted birds the world ever
saw.</p>

<p>In course of time the Prince and Princess
had other children, who pleased the old
King better than the first had done. But
the parents loved none better than the two
who lived as herons by the great fish-pond
in the wood; nor could there be greater love
than was found between these and their
younger brothers and sisters, whose nature
it was to be real persons.</p>

<h3>SYRINGA</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A great many years ago
there lived a King who
spent his days in travelling
about to find the woman
he could love and take to
be his wife. Though the
richest and most beautiful princesses offered
him their hands in marriage, for none of
them could he entertain the smallest affection.
“It seems that I have had a dream,”
he said. “Somewhere my Love is, but I
have not found her yet!”</p>

<p>In those days the country over which he
was lord had two Kings, one reigned and
the other ruled; and as long as this was
so, since his brother-King who ruled was
married, his councillors allowed him who
merely reigned to wander about at will in
pursuit of his strange fancy.</p>

<p>When, however, the King who ruled died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
without leaving an heir, then those same
councillors said, “This will not do; the
State can wait no longer. Princes are
born, and Kings die; love or no love, for
your people’s sake you must marry!”</p>

<p>“Then why does he not marry me?”
said the Queen-widow of the King that
ruled.</p>

<p>The King that reigned said, “Rather
than marry her I would marry my scullery-maid!”
He became so terrified at the
thought of her proposal that he took horse
secretly by night, and rode away into the
most secluded and uninhabited parts of his
dominion.</p>

<p>Now here, as he rode along over many
miles of barren moor and hill, one day,
crossing a high ridge, he met the wind
coming softly up out of the valley below
him, and its breath upon his face was full
of the perfume of some sweet flower. At
that his heart, which had been so long
listless and sad, seemed to awake within
him. “Flower of my dream!” he cried;
and soon saw below him, nestling in a
corner of the valley, a small garden half
hidden in the embrace of tall girdling
trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>Down he went joyfully, following the
fragrant call till he came to the entrance of
the place; and there, dismounting from his
horse, he entered its green ways. A natural
lawn mounted and hollowed before him in
glossy sweeps, flowering shrubs dotted its
heights, for the summer of the year was
begun; but the scent which had taken hold
of his heart came from a great bush of
white bloom in the centre of all.</p>

<p>Under the bush lay a young and beautiful
girl, and the blossoms were sprinkling
down, one by one, like dropped kisses
upon her dear face. So soon as the King
saw her he knew that his search was at an
end, and that his dream of years had come
true.</p>

<p>Their glad eyes met softly through the
flowers; and he said, “You had but to
breathe for me, and I came!” For all her
face and breath smelt to him of the
blossoms she lay under.</p>

<p>She answered, “Three years I have lain
with my ear upon the ground, and heard
you going and coming, searching the world
through; and now at last you are come!”
She rose up to the King’s embrace, and
they were to each other like old lovers long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
parted and at last met, so long had they
known of love in their dreams.</p>

<p>Twilight was beginning as they turned
and went out of the garden. The King
said, “What is your name all these years?”</p>

<p>And she answered him with a voice like
a bird singing, “Syringa my name was,
Syringa my name is, and will be while life
lasts.”</p>

<p>When they left the valley and went
mounting the side of the hill, a sweet wind
rose and rose, and came following them.
All the way, as they rode, white blossoms
came showering behind them, falling upon
their faces and their hair, and whitening
the track at their feet. Up to the city
gates, where all the King’s court and his
councillors stood watching and waiting for
his return, the blossoms kept following
them, like little scented moths fluttering
round them in the darkness.</p>

<p>When the gates were opened, the whole
city became full of the scent of the bride’s
name.</p>

<p>So the marriage of the King who reigned
was celebrated with all the joy and noise
imaginable; for all the people laughed and
shouted and clapped their hands when their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
eyes saw the beauty of the new Queen. But
the dowager Queen, the widow of the King
who ruled, put on yellow weeds, and shut
herself up in a corner of the palace, eating
unleavened bread and bitter herb sandwiches
till all the rejoicings were over.</p>

<p>In a little while, however, she appeared
to forget her grief, and, concealing her
jealousy, made friends with the King who
reigned, and with his Queen; and the King
was glad in his great happiness to think
that no heart in all the kingdom remained
under a cloud.</p>

<p>For nearly a year the happiness of the
King and Queen lasted and grew perfect.
Every day that they lived together they
loved each other more and more. But the
Queen-widow waited and watched till an
opportunity for her evil working should
come in.</p>

<p>Presently people who looked at Syringa’s
beauty began to say, “Is not such beauty
more than human? Where does it come
from, and what keeps it alive?” And
though many in course of time learned to
talk like this, no one ever seemed to know
from whom such talk first came. Later,
folk began to whisper instead of to talk.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
“We have heard,” they said, “one way by
which such beauty can be kept alive, yet
only one.” Then others were heard saying,
“Have you heard that this man’s wife lost
her child before it was a week old, and
knows not where it can be gone; and that
that man’s wife lost hers in the same way a
week before? And who will lose hers this
week that’s coming, if we don’t know yet,
we soon shall know!” And shortly, sure
enough, all through the city there were
mothers mourning for the loss of their
children, who had gone, none knew where,
before they were even a week old; and
more and more the crowd was taught to
say, “Look how beautiful the Queen
grows!” whenever she walked or rode.</p>

<p>The Queen-widow listened to all this,
and laughed. In her own chamber she had
a cage filled with little blue birds, who
cried lamentably all day long.</p>

<p>Now, just when all the city-talk and the
dark looks of the people had grown to a
head, Queen Syringa gave birth to a little
son; and the King’s joy was beyond all
bounds. “Now,” thought the Queen-widow,
“now or never! Now I will ruin
her or die!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>She watched her opportunity, till one day
she found Syringa lying alone upon her
couch with the child asleep between her
arms.</p>

<p>The wicked Queen saw that Syringa also
was asleep. She stooped down over the
child, whispering a spell, and as she clapped
her hands it started from between its
mother’s arms and flew away in the form of
a little blue bird.</p>

<p>The Queen-widow did her best to catch
the bird, but could not; then she took
blood, and, smearing the Queen’s hands
and face with it, left her lying there asleep.</p>

<p>So Syringa was found; and the noise of
it went through the city how she had killed
her own child in order to keep alive her
wondrous beauty. The King tried with
heart and soul not to believe so wicked
a story against the wife he loved, but the
evidence was too strong. When asked, the
Queen could explain nothing. “When I
went to sleep,” she said, “my child was in
my arms, and when I awoke it was gone!”</p>

<p>Outside the palace all the people were
crying for her to be put to death. “Give
back to their mothers the babies that you
have eaten!” they cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>The King sent for his foster-brother,
and told him to take the Queen away to
some lonely and desolate place, and there to
make an end of her. “She is too beautiful,”
he said, “and I loved her too much.
Let her be very far away from me when
she dies!”</p>

<p>So that night the King’s foster-brother
took the Queen, and set out in the direction
of the waste places and the hills. All
the day following they journeyed, till toward
evening they came to the head of a
valley, where a wind came to them carrying
the rich scent of flowers. The Queen lifted
her head and took in a deep breath; then
she said, “If I have to die, let me die under
the scent of those flowers!”</p>

<p>They went on till they came to a little
garden lying in a curl of the valley. There
in the centre of a lawn stood the great
bush white with bloom, and a sweet fragrance
blew out of it, filling all that
space.</p>

<p>“If I must die,” said the Queen again,
“let me lie down and drink in the scent of
those flowers; afterwards I shall not complain.”
So the King’s foster-brother gave
her leave to go and lie down under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
tree, and sat down close at hand to keep
watch, so that she should not escape.</p>

<p>A small blue bird came and perched upon
the bush over her head.</p>

<p>“Syringa, Syringa!” cried the bird, and
two white blossoms fell off like kisses upon
the Queen’s face. She lifted her hands and
threw kisses up to the flowers, and more
and more they came down and settled upon
her face.</p>

<p>“Syringa, Syringa!” sang the bird; and,
hearing it, the King’s foster-brother’s heart
became ready to break for grief.</p>

<p>The twilight deepened in the air around.
All through the hours the bird sang on,
and the flowers dropped down like pale
tired moths in the dusk of the summer’s
night, till where the Queen lay became
white with a mass of blossoms that never
stirred.</p>

<p>The heart of the King’s foster-brother
grew heavier; “What if, after all, she be
not wicked but good! To-morrow at sunrise
I must kill her.”</p>

<p>“Syringa, Syringa!” cried the bird.</p>

<p>Towards dawn he saw the tree all blossomless,
only a great heap of petals, like
a snow-covered grave, showed where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Queen lay; and the song of the bird had
stopped.</p>

<p>“If she sleeps now,” thought the King’s
foster-brother, “it will be merciful.” He
drew out his sharp hunting-knife, and went
softly up to the spot to carry out the
King’s command.</p>

<p>So covered was she with blossoms, he
could not tell which way lay her head; the
heaviness of their dying scent almost made
him swoon. Softly with his hand he
brushed the petals apart to find a place
where he might strike.</p>

<p>How deeply they lay! They seemed to
be without end here in the centre of all.
Presently his hand came upon green grass
bent with the weight of blossoms, and dank
with dew. He shut his eyes and started
away, for the colour and the touch made a
strange sorrow in his heart, and he knew
that the Queen was not there.</p>

<p>He went away to the furthest part of
the garden, and returned, and again searched,
and still she was not there; only blossoms
in a pile, and under them green grass.</p>

<p>“Syringa, Syringa!” sang the bird; and
now there was a sort of triumph in its
note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>The King’s foster-brother turned and
went back to the city. All the way the
blossoms drifted and blew after him along
the track; till at evening he stood at the
palace door in a wind of syringa scent, and
dead flowers blew over his feet as he crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>Then he told the King all that he had
seen and heard, and the King knew surely
that his Queen, who had died so gentle and
beloved a death, had been innocent of the
crime laid to her charge. So great was his
grief he could not rest; that very night he
rose and journeyed till he came by day to
the little garden; there he found the tree
blossomless, and in the top of it he heard
the blue bird crying, “Syringa, Syringa,”
sadly and without ceasing.</p>

<p>But to the King there came no sign or
sound of his love. He laid his head upon
the ground at the foot of the tree, sighing,
“My love, you lay three years with your
ear to the ground listening for my feet;
now I will lie and listen for yours!”</p>

<p>All the grass became wet with the tears
of sorrow that the King shed; the tree
waved and grew more green. In three
days new blossoms looked out among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
leaves; at night they fell upon his face,
and he dreamed that Syringa’s lips were
laid to his ear, and the tale of her betrayal
whispered to him.</p>

<p>Then, knowing all, but determined for a
time to let the truth lie buried in his heart, he
caused the tree to be lifted from the ground
and carried back and set secretly in the palace
garden. And of all this, and of what he
knew, he said nothing to the Queen-widow.</p>

<p>To the little blue bird that had followed
the tree, and perched in its boughs, he
said, “Be silent, little blue bird, and do
not sing that name here.” At his word
the little blue bird became silent as death,
and sat motionless in the heart of the tree,
never once breathing Syringa’s name.</p>

<p>At night the Prince would come and
press his lips to the leaves of the tree and
whisper, “Ah, love, how long is my heart
to stay broken? And when will forgiveness
blossom?”</p>

<p>But to the Queen-widow it appeared that
the Prince was recovering from his grief;
and when a year had gone round she began
wooing him by stealth, seeming to pity him
for the sorrow that the wickedness of his
dead Queen had caused him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>Little by little he seemed to listen and
open his heart to her; once he said, “All
my grief would go if one whom I love could
know that my heart, which once turned from
her, has become wholly hers again.”</p>

<p>When the Queen-widow heard that said,
she thought, “Surely now, in a short time,
all my schemes are to be brought to a good
end.”</p>

<p>One day as they walked and talked together
in the gardens of the palace, they
came upon a tree white and covered with
blossom. “How I love that flower!” said
the King; but the Queen-widow as soon
as she smelt the scent of it turned pale and
trembled. Up among the branches sat a
little blue bird silently.</p>

<p>“Come here, and sit under this tree,”
said the King, “and let me speak freely, for
I am in sore want of a wife!” He drew
her close under the leaves of the tree.
“Here,” he thought, “I will make her
speak; she shall confess all!” Over them
a bough leaned down.</p>

<p>One of its blossoms touched the Queen-widow
on the throat. “It has bitten me!”
she shrieked. The branch sprang away, the
whole tree opened and waved. Out of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the blossoms flew like a white swarm of
angry bees.</p>

<p>“Syringa, Syringa!” cried the bird.</p>

<p>The Queen-widow caught herself by the
throat and moaned, and lay down upon the
grass to die.</p>

<p>As soon as her breath was gone, all the
blossoms rose up again like a white column
of cloud; down into their midst flew the blue
bird.</p>

<p>Then, this way and that, the blossoms
cast themselves loose into the wind, and out
of their midst came Syringa herself, carrying
her child in her arms. At her feet the
Queen-widow lay quite dead, with her hand
upon her throat. The little blue birds in
the palace had broken out of their cage and
were calling for their mothers with childish
voices and laughter.</p>

<p>But the King knelt down before Syringa’s
feet, pale and trembling, seeking pardon for
having ever believed in her guilt. Swiftly
Queen Syringa bent down, and in token
of forgiveness held her child’s lips to his.
Over them both her face and breath were
fragrant as a garden full of sunshine.</p>

<p>When the King had kissed the child’s
lips, she gave him her own.</p>

<h3>THE TRAVELLER’S SHOES</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A long while ago there
lived a young cobbler named
Lubin, who, when his father
died, was left with only the
shop and the shoe-leather
out of which to make his
fortune. From morning to night he toiled,
making and mending the shoes of the poor
village folk; but his earnings were small,
and he seemed never able to get more than
three days ahead of poverty.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat working at his window-bench,
the door opened, and in came a
traveller. He had on a pair of long red
shoes with pointed ends; but of one the
seams had split, so that all his toes were
coming out of it.</p>

<p>The stranger, putting up one foot after
the other, took off both shoes, and giving
that one which wanted cobbling to Lubin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
he said: “To-night I shall be sleeping here
at the inn; have this ready in good time
to-morrow, for I am in haste to go on!”
And having said this he put the other shoe
into his pocket, and went out of the door
barefoot.</p>

<p>“What a funny fellow,” thought Lubin,
“not to make the most of one shoe when
he has it!” But without stopping to
puzzle himself he took up the to-be-mended
shoe and set to work. When it was finished
he threw it down on the floor behind him,
and went on working at his other jobs.
He meant to work late, for he had not
enough money yet to get himself his Sunday’s
dinner; so when darkness shut in he
lighted a rushlight and cobbled away, thinking
to himself all the while of the roast
meat that was to be his reward.</p>

<p>It came close on midnight, and he was
just putting on the last heel of the last pair
of shoes when he was aware of a noise on
the floor behind him. He looked round,
and there was the red shoe with the pointed
toe, cutting capers and prancing about by
itself in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>“Peace on earth!” exclaimed Lubin.
“I never saw a shoe do a thing so tipsy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
before!” He went up and passed his hand
over it and under it, but there was nothing
to account for its caperings; on it went,
up and down, toeing and heeling, skipping
and sliding, as if for a very wager. Lubin
could even tell himself the name of the reel
and the tune that it was dancing to, for all
that the other foot was missing. Presently
the shoe tripped and toppled, falling heel
up upon the floor; nor, although Lubin
watched it for a full hour, did it ever start
upon a fresh jig.</p>

<p>Soon after daybreak, when Lubin had but
just opened his shutters and sat himself
down to work, in came the traveller, limping
upon bare feet, with the shoe’s fellow
pointing its red toe out of his pocket.
“Oh, so,” he said, seeing the other shoe
ready mended and waiting for him, “how
much am I owing you for the job?”</p>

<p>“Just a gold piece,” said Lubin, carelessly,
carrying on at his work.</p>

<p>“A gold piece for the mere mending of
a shoe!” cried the stranger. “You must
be either a rogue or a funny fellow.”</p>

<p>“Neither!” said Lubin, “and for mending
a shoe my charge is only a penny; but
for mending <i>that</i> shoe, and for all the worry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
and temptation to make it my own and run
off with it—a gold piece!”</p>

<p>“To be sure, you are an honest fellow,”
said the traveller, “and honesty is a rare
gift; though, had you made off with it, I
should have soon caught you. Still, you
were not so wise as to know that, so here’s
your gold piece for you.” He pulled out
a big bag of gold as he spoke, pouring its
contents out on to the window bench.</p>

<p>“That is a lot of money for a lonely man
to carry about,” said Lubin. “Are you not
afraid?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” answered the man. “I have
a way, so that I can always follow it up
even if I lose it.” He took two of the gold
pieces, and dropped one into the sole of
each shoe as he was putting them on.
“There!” said he, “now, if any man steal
my money, I need only wait till it is midnight;
and then I have but to say to my
shoes ‘Seek!’ and up they jump, with
me in them, and carry me to where my
stolen property is, were it to the world’s
end. It is as if they had the nose and
sagacity of a pair of bloodhounds. Ah,
son of a cobbler, had you run off with the
one I should have very soon caught you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
with the other; for if one walks the other
is bound to follow. But, as you were
honest, we part friends; and I trust God
may bring you to fortune.” Then the
traveller did up his bag of gold, nodded to
the cobbler from the doorway, and was gone.</p>

<p>Lubin laid down his work, and went off
to the inn. “Did anything happen here
last night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing of much note,” answered the
innkeeper. “Three travelling fiddlers
were here, and afterwards a man came
in barefoot, but with a red shoe sticking
out of his pocket. I thought of turning
the fellow away, till he let me see
the colour of his gold. Presently the
fiddlers started to play and the other man
to drink. At first when they called on him
to dance he excused himself for his feet’s
sake; but presently, what with the music
and the liquor, he got so lively in his head
that he pulled on his one shoe and danced
like three ordinary men put together.”</p>

<p>“What time was that?” asked Lubin.</p>

<p>“Getting on for midnight,” answered the
innkeeper.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Lubin, and went home
thinking much on the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Towards evening he found that he had
run out of leather, and must go into the
town, ten miles off, to buy more. “Now
my gold piece comes in handy,” thought
he; so he locked up the house, put the key
in his pocket, and set out.</p>

<p>Though it was the season of long days
it was growing dark when he came to a part
of the road that led through the wood; but
being so poor a man he had no fear, nor
thought at all about the robbers who were
said to be in those parts. But as he went,
he saw all at once by the side of the road
two red spikes sticking up out of a ditch,
their bright colour making them plain to
the eye. He came quite near and saw that
they were two red shoes with pointed toes;
and then he saw more clearly that along
with them lay the traveller, his wallet empty
and with a dagger stuck through his heart.</p>

<p>The cobbler’s son was as sorry as he could
be. “Alas, poor soul,” thought he, “what
good are the shoes to you now? Now that
thieves have killed you and taken away your
gold, surely I do no harm if I give an honest
man your shoes!” He stooped down,
and was about taking them off when he saw
the eyes of the dead man open. The eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
looked at him as if they would remind him
of something; and at once, when he loosed
hold of the shoes, they seemed satisfied.
Then he remembered, and thought to himself,
“The world has many marvels in it; I
will wait till midnight and see.”</p>

<p>For over three hours he kept watch by
the dead man’s side. “Only last night,”
he said to himself, “this poor fellow was
dancing as merry a measure as ever I saw,
for the half of it surely I saw; and now!”
Then he judged that midnight must be
come, so he bent over the shoes and whispered
to them but one word.</p>

<p>The dead man stood up in his shoes and
began running. Lubin followed close,
keeping an eye on him, for the shoes made
no sound on the earth. They ran on for
two hours, till they had come to the thickest
part of the forest; then some way before
them Lubin began to see a light shining.
It came from a small square house in a
court-yard, and round the court-yard lay a
deep moat; only one narrow plank led over
and up to the entrance.</p>

<p>The red shoes, carrying the dead man,
walked over, and Lubin followed them.
When they were at the other side they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
turned, facing toward the plank that they
had crossed, and Lubin seemed to read in
the dead man’s eye what he was to do.</p>

<p>Then he turned and lifted the plank
away from over the moat, so that there was
no longer any entrance or exit to the place.
Through the window of the house he could
see the three fiddlers quarrelling over the
dead man’s gold.</p>

<p>The red shoes went on, carrying their
dead owner, till they got to the threshold,
and there stopped. Then Lubin came and
clicked up the latch, and pushed open the
door, and in walked the dead man with the
dagger sticking out of his heart.</p>

<p>The three fiddlers, when they saw that
sight, dropped their gold and leapt out of
the window; and as they fled, shrieking,
thinking to cross the moat by the plank-bridge
that was no longer there, one after
the other they fell into the water, and, clutching
each other by the throat, were drowned.</p>

<p>But the red shoes stayed where they were,
and, tilting up his feet, let the traveller go
gently upon the ground; and when Lubin
held down the lantern to his face, on it lay
a good smile, to tell him that the dead
man thanked him for all he had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>So in the morning Lubin went and
fetched a priest to pray for the repose of
the traveller’s soul, and to give him good
burial; and to him he gave all the dead
man’s money, but for himself he took the
red shoes with the pointed toes, and set out
to make his fortune in the world.</p>

<p>Walking along he found that however
far he went he never grew tired. When he
had gone on for more than a hundred miles,
he came to the capital where the King lived
with his Court.</p>

<p>All the flags of the city were at half-mast,
and all the people were in half mourning.
Lubin asked at the first inn where he stopped
what it all meant.</p>

<p>“You must indeed be a stranger,” said
his host, “not to know, for ’tis now nearly
a year since this trouble began; and this
very night more cause for mourning becomes
due.”</p>

<p>“Tell me of it, then,” said Lubin, “for
I know nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“At least,” returned the innkeeper, “you
will know how, a little more than a year
ago, the Queen, who was the most beautiful
woman in the world, died, leaving the King
with twelve daughters, who, after her, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
reckoned the fairest women on earth, though
the King says that all their beauty rolled
into one would not equal that of his dead
wife; and, indeed, poor man, there is no
doubt that he loved her devotedly during
her life, and mourns for her continually
now she is dead.”</p>

<p>“Only a small part of all this have I
known,” said Lubin.</p>

<p>“Well, but at least,” said the innkeeper,
“you will have heard how the Princesses
were famed for their hair; so beautiful it
was, so golden, and so long! And now, at
every full moon, one of them goes bald in
a night; and bald her head stays as a
stone, for never an inch of hair grows on
it again; and with her hair all her beauty
goes pale, so that she is but the shadow
of her former self—a thin-blooded thing,
as if a vampire had come and sucked
out half her life. Yes; ten months this
has happened, and ten of the Princesses
have lost their looks and their hair as well;
and now only the Princess Royal and
the youngest of all remain untouched;
and doubtless one of them is to lose her
crop to-night.”</p>

<p>“But how does it happen?” cried Lubin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
“Is no one put to keep watch, to guard
them from the thing being done?”</p>

<p>“Ah! you talk, you talk!” said the
innkeeper. “How? The King has offered
half his kingdom to anyone who can tell
him how the mischief is done; and the
other half to the man who will put an end
to it. To put it shortly, if you believe
yourself a clever enough man, you may
have the King for your father-in-law, with
the pick of his daughters for your bride,
and be his heir and lord of all when he
dies!”</p>

<p>“For such a reward,” said Lubin, “has
no man made the attempt?”</p>

<p>“Aye, one a month; every time there
has been some man fool enough to think
himself so clever; and he has been turned
out of the palace next day with his ears
cropped.”</p>

<p>“I will risk having my ears cropped,”
said Lubin; for his heart was sorry for
the young Princesses, and the vanishing of
their beauty. So he went up and knocked
at the gates of the palace.</p>

<p>They went and told the King that a new
man had come willing and wanting to have
his ears cropped on the morrow. “Well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
well,” said the King, “let the poor fool
in!” for indeed he had given up all hope.
From the King Lubin heard the whole
story over again. The old man sighed so,
it took him whole hours to tell it.</p>

<p>“I would be glad to be your son,” said
Lubin, when the King had ended; “but I
would like better to make you rid of your
sorrow.”</p>

<p>“That is kind of you,” said the King.
“Perhaps I will only crop one of your ears
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“When may one see the Princesses?”
asked Lubin.</p>

<p>“They will be down to supper, presently,”
answered the King; “then you
shall see them, what there is left of them.”</p>

<p>Though it was reckoned that the next
day Lubin would have to be drummed out
of the palace with his ears cropped short,
on this day he was to be treated like an
honoured guest. When they went in to
supper the King made him sit upon his
right hand.</p>

<p>The twelve Princesses came in, their
heads bowed down with weeping; all were
fair, but ten of them were thin and pale,
and wore white wimples over their heads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
like nuns; only the Princess Royal, who
was the eldest, and Princess Lyneth, who
was the youngest, had gold hair down to
their feet, and were both so shiningly beautiful
that the poor cobbler was altogether
dazzled by the sight of them.</p>

<p>The King looked out of the window and
said: “Heigho! There is the full moon
beginning to rise.” Then they all said
grace, and sat down.</p>

<p>But when the viands were handed round,
all the Princesses sat weeping into their
plates, and seemed unable to eat anything.
For the pale and thin ones said: “To-night
another of our sisters will lose her
golden hair and her good looks, and be like
us!” Therefore they wept.</p>

<p>And Lyneth said: “To-night, either my
dear sister or myself will fall under the
spell!” Therefore she wept more than
the other ten. But the Princess Royal sat
trembling, and crying:</p>

<p>“To-night I know that the curse is to
fall upon me, and me only!” Therefore
she wept more than all.</p>

<p>Lubin sat, and watched, and listened,
with his head bent down over his golden
plate. “Which of these two shall I try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
most to save?” he thought. “How shall
I test them, so as to know? If I could
only tell which of them was to lose her hair
to-night, then I might do something.”</p>

<p>He saw that the youngest sister cried so
much that she could eat nothing; but the
Princess Royal, between her bursts of grief,
picked up a morsel now and again from
her plate, and ate it as though courage or
despair reminded her that she must yet
strive to live.</p>

<p>When the meat-courses were over, the
King said to the Princesses: “I wish you
would try to eat a little pudding! Here
is a very promising youth, who is determined
by all that is in him that harm shall
happen to none of you to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow he will be sent away with
his ears cut short!” said Princess Lyneth;
and her tears, as she spoke, ran down over
the edge of her plate on to the cloth.</p>

<p>When supper was over the Princess
Royal came up to Lubin, and said: “Do
not be angry with my sister for what she
said! It has only been too true of many
who came before; to-night, unless you do
better than them all, I shall lose my hair.
It has been a wonder to me how I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
been spared so long, seeing that I am the
eldest, and, as some will have it, the fairest.
Will you keep a good guard over me to-night,
as though you knew for certain that
I am to be the one this time to suffer?”</p>

<p>“I will guard you as my own life,” said
Lubin, “if you will but do as I ask you.”</p>

<p>“Pledge yourself to me, then, in this
cup!” said she, and lifted to his lips a
bowl of red wine. Over the edge of it her
eyes shone beautifully; he drank, gazing
into their clear depth.</p>

<p>“Where am I to be for the night,” he
asked of the King, “so that I may watch
over the two Princesses?”</p>

<p>The King took him to a chamber with
two further doors that opened out of it.
“Here,” said the King, “you are to sleep,
and in the inner rooms sleep the Princess
Royal and the Princess Lyneth. There is
no entrance or exit to them but through
this; therefore, when you are here with
your door bolted, one would suppose that
you had them safe. Alas! ten other men
have tried like you to ward off the harm,
and have failed; and so to-day I have ten
daughters with no looks left to them, and
no hair upon their heads.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>As they were speaking, the two Princesses,
with their sisters, came up to bed. And
the pale ones, wearing their white wimples,
came and kissed the golden hair of the
other two, crying over it, and saying, “To
one of you we are saying good-bye; to-morrow
one of you will be like us!”
Then they went away to their sleeping-place,
and the Princess Royal and Lyneth
kissed each other, and parted weeping, each
into her own chamber.</p>

<p>“Watch well over us!” said Lyneth to
Lubin, as she passed through. “Watch
over me!” said the Princess Royal. And
then the two doors were closed.</p>

<p>Lubin said to the King, “Could I now
see the two Princesses, without being seen
by them, it would help me to know what
to do.”</p>

<p>“Come down to my cabinet,” said the
King. “I have an invisible cap there, that
I can lend you if you think you can do any
good with it.” So they went; and the
King reached down the cap from the wall
and gave it to Lubin.</p>

<p>“Now, good-night, your Majesty,” said
Lubin; “I will do for you all I can.”</p>

<p>The King answered, “Either you shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
be my son-in-law to-morrow, or you shall
have no ears. My wishes are with you
that the former state may be yours.”</p>

<p>Lubin went into his chamber and closed
and bolted the door; then he put the bed
up against it. “Now, at least,” he thought,
“there are three of us, and no more!”
He put on his invisible cap, and going
softly to the Princess Royal’s door, opened
it and peeped in.</p>

<p>She stood up before her glass, combing
out her long gold hair, and smiling proudly
because of its beauty. She gathered it up
by all its ends and kissed it; then, letting it
fall, she went on combing as before.</p>

<p>Lubin went out, closing the door again;
then he took off his cap and knocked, and
presently he heard the Princess Royal
saying, “Come in!” She was lying down
upon the bed, squeezing her eyes with her
hands.</p>

<p>“Princess,” he said, “I will watch over
you like my own life, if you will do what I
bid you. I am but a poor man, and the
best that I can do is but poor; but I think,
if you will, I can save your head from
becoming as bare as a billiard ball.”</p>

<p>The Princess asked him how.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“You know,” said he, “that to-night
something is to happen to one of you”
(“To me?” said the Princess), “and all
your hair will be stolen in such a way that
nothing will ever make it grow again. See,
here I have a pair of common scissors; let
me but cut your hair close off all over your
head, and then who can steal it? For a
few months you will be a fright, but it can
grow again.”</p>

<p>“I think you are a silly fellow!” said
the Princess. “Better for you to get to
bed, and have your ears cropped quietly in
the morning! After all, it may be my
sister’s turn to lose her hair, not mine. I
shall not make myself a fright for a year of
my life in order to save you.”</p>

<p>“If you think so poorly of my offer,”
said Lubin, “I had better go to bed and
sleep, and not trouble the Princess Lyneth
at all with it.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” said the Princess Royal.
“Go to bed and sleep, poor fool!” And,
in truth, Lubin was feeling so sleepy that
he could hardly keep open his eyes.</p>

<p>Then he left her, and, pulling the invisible
cap once more over his head, crept
softly into Princess Lyneth’s chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>She was standing before her glass with all
her beautiful hair flowing down from
shoulders to feet; and tears were falling
fast out of her eyes as she kept drawing
her hair together in her hands, kissing and
moaning over it.</p>

<p>Then Lubin went out again, and, taking
off his cap, knocked softly at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” said the Princess; and
when he went in she was still standing
before the glass weeping and moaning for
her beautiful hair, that might never see
another day. On the bed was lying a
white wimple, ready for her to put on
when her head was become bald.</p>

<p>“Princess,” said Lubin, very humbly,
“will you help me to save your beautiful
hair, by doing what I ask?”</p>

<p>“What is it that you ask?” said she.</p>

<p>“Only this,” he answered; “I am a poor
man, and cannot do much for you, but only
my best. To-night you or your sister must
lose your hair; and we know that afterwards,
if that happen, it can never grow
again. Now, come, here I have a common
pair of scissors; if I could cut your hair
quite short, in a few months it will grow
again, and there will be nothing to-night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
that the Fates can steal. Will you let me
do this for you in true service?”</p>

<p>The Princess looked at him, and looked
at her glass. “Oh, my hair, my hair!”
she moaned. Then she said, “What
matters it? You mean to be good to me,
and a month is the most that my fortune
can last. If I do not lose it to-night, I
lose it at the next full moon!” Then she
shut her eyes and bade him take off all he
wished. When he had finished, she picked
up the wimple and covered her head with
it; but Lubin took up the long coil of
gold hair and wound it round his heart.</p>

<p>He knelt down at her feet. “Princess,”
he said, “be sure now that I can save you!
Only I have one other request to make.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked the Princess.</p>

<p>He took off one of his red shoes with
the pointed toes. “Will you, for a strange
thing, put on this shoe and wear it all
to-night in your sleep? And in the morning
I will ask you for it again.”</p>

<p>The Princess promised faithfully that
she would do so. Even before he had left
the room she had put foot in it, promising
that only he should take it off again.</p>

<p>Lubin’s eyes were shut down with sleep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
as he groped his way to bed; he lay down
with the other red shoe upon his foot.
“Watch for your fellow!” he said to it;
and then his senses left him and he was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, while he was
deep in slumber, the red shoe caught him
by the foot and yanked him out of bed;
he woke up to find himself standing in the
middle of the room, and there before him
stood the two doors of the inner chambers
open; through that of the Princess Royal
came a light. He heard the Princess
Lyneth getting very softly out of her bed,
and presently she stood in the doorway,
with her hands out and her eyes fast shut;
and the red shoe was on one foot, and the
white wimple on her head. Little tears were
running down from under her closed lids;
and she sighed continually in her sleep.
“Have pity on me!” she said.</p>

<p>She crossed slowly from one door to the
other; and Lubin, putting on his invisible
cap, crept softly after her. The Princess
Royal’s chamber was empty, but her glass
was opened away from the wall like a door,
and beyond lay a passage and steps. At
the top of the steps was another door, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
through it light came, and the sound of a
soft voice singing.</p>

<p>Princess Lyneth, knowing nothing in her
sleep, passed along the passage and up the
steps till she came to the further doorway.
Looking over her shoulder Lubin saw the
Princess Royal sitting before a loom. In it
lay a great cloth of gold, like a bride’s
mantle, into which she was weaving the last
threads of her skein. Close to her side lay
a pair of great shears that shone like blue
fire; and while she sang they opened and
snapped, keeping time to the music she
made.</p>

<p>Without ever turning her head the Princess
Royal sat passing her fingers along the
woof and crying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sister, sister, bring me your hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of our Mother’s beauty give me your share.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You must grow pale, while I must grow fair!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And while she was so singing, Lyneth
drew nearer and nearer, with her eyes fast
shut, and the white wimple over her head.
“Have pity on me!” she said, speaking in
her sleep.</p>

<p>As soon as the Princess Royal heard that
she laughed for joy, and catching up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
great flaming shears, turned herself round
to where Lyneth was standing. Then she
opened the shears, and took hold of the
wimple, and pulled it down.</p>

<p>All in a moment she was choking with
rage, for horrible was the sight that met her
eye. “Ah! cobbler’s son,” cried she, “you
shall die for this! To-morrow not only
shall you have your two ears cropped, but
you shall die: do not be afraid!”</p>

<p>Lubin looked at her and smiled, knowing
how little she thought that he heard her
words. “Ah! Princess Royal,” he said to
himself, “there is another who should now
be afraid, but is not.”</p>

<p>Then for very spite the Princess began
slapping her sister’s face. “Ah! wicked
little sister,” she cried, “you have cheated
me this time! But go back and wait till
your hair has grown, and then my gown of
gold shall be finished, although this once
you have been too sly!” She threw down
the shears, and drove her sister back by
stair and passage, and through the looking-glass
door at the other end.</p>

<p>Lubin following, stayed first to watch
how by a secret spring the Princess Royal
closed the mirror back into the wall; then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
he slipped on before, and taking off his cap,
lay down on his bed pretending to be fast
asleep. He heard Princess Lyneth return to
her couch, and then came the Princess Royal
and ground her teeth at him in the darkness.</p>

<p>Presently she, too, returned to her bed
and lay down; and an hour after Lubin got
up very softly and went into her chamber.
There she lay asleep, with her beautiful hair
all spread out upon the pillow; but Lubin
had Princess Lyneth’s hair wound round
his heart. He touched the secret spring, so
that the mirror opened to him, and he
passed through toward the little chamber
where stood the loom.</p>

<p>There hung the cloth of gold, all but
finished; beside it the shears opened and
snapped, giving out a blue light. He took
up the shears in his hand, and pulled down
the gold web from the loom, and back he
went, closing the mirror behind him.</p>

<p>Then he came to the Princess Royal as
she lay asleep; and first he laid the cloth of
gold over her, and saw how at once she
became ten times more fair than she was by
rights, as fair almost as her dead mother,
lacking one part only. But her beauty did
not win him to have pity on her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“There can be thieves, it seems, in high
places!” he said; and with that he opened
the shears over her head and let them snap:
then all her long hair came out by the roots,
and she lay white and withered before his
eyes, and as bald as a stone.</p>

<p>He gathered up all her hair with one
hand, and the cloth of gold with the other,
and went quietly away. Then, hiding the
shears in a safe place, first he burnt the
Princess Royal’s hair, till it became only a
little heap of frizzled cinders; and after that
he went to the chamber of the ten Princesses,
whose hair and whose sweet youth
had been stolen from them. There they
lay all in a row in ten beds, with pale, gentle
faces, asleep under their white wimples.</p>

<p>He went to the first, and, laying the cloth
of hair over her, cried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sister, sister, I bring you your hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of your Mother’s beauty I give you your share.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One must grow pale, but you must grow fair!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And as he said the words one part of the
cloth unwove itself from the rest, and ran
in ripples up the coverlet, and on to the
pillow where the Princess’s head lay. There
it coiled itself under the wimple, a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
mass of shining gold, and the face of the
Princess flushed warm and lovely in her
sleep.</p>

<p>Lubin passed on to the next bed, and
there uttered the same words; and again one
part of the web came loose, and wound
itself about the sleeper’s face, that grew
warm and lovely at its touch. So he went
from bed to bed, and when he came to the
end there was no more of the web left.</p>

<p>He went back into his own chamber,
laughing in his heart for joy, and there he
dropped himself between the sheets and fell
into a sound slumber.</p>

<p>He was wakened in the morning by the
King knocking and trying to get into the
room. Lubin pulled back the bed, and in
came the King with a mournful countenance.</p>

<p>“Which of them is it?” said he.</p>

<p>“Go and ask them!” said Lubin.</p>

<p>The King went over and knocked at the
Princess Royal’s door; the knocking opened
her eyes. Lubin heard her suddenly utter a
yell. “Ah! now she has looked at herself
in the glass,” thought he.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” called the King.
“Come out and let me look at you!” But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the Princess Royal would not come out.
She ran quick to her mirror, and touched
the secret spring. “At least,” she thought,
“though fiends have robbed me of all my
beauty, I can get it back by wearing the
cloth woven from my sisters’ hair!” She
skipped along the passage and up the steps
to the little chamber where the loom was.</p>

<p>The King, getting no answer, went across
and knocked at Lyneth’s door; she came
out, all fresh in her beauty, but wearing
upon her head the wimple. “Ah!” said
the King dolorously; and he snipped his
fingers at Lubin.</p>

<p>Lubin laughed out. “But look at her
face!” he said. “Surely she is beautiful
enough?”</p>

<p>The Princess lifted up her wimple, and
showed the King her hair all short beneath.
“That was my doing,” said Lubin; “’twas
the way of saving it.”</p>

<p>“What a Dutchman’s remedy!” cried the
King; and just then the Princess Royal’s
door flew open.</p>

<p>She came out tearing herself to pieces
with rage; her face was pale and thin, and
her head was as bare as a billiard ball.
“Have that clown of a cobbler killed!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
she cried in a passion. “That fool, that
numbskull, that cheat! Have him beheaded,
I say!”</p>

<p>“No, no, I am only to have one of my
ears cropped off!” said Lubin, looking hard
at her all the time.</p>

<p>“I am not at all sure,” said the King.
“You have done foolishly and badly, for
not only have you let the disease go on, but
your very remedy is as bad. Two heads
of hair gone in one night! You had better
have kept away. If the Princesses wish it,
certainly I will have you put to death.”</p>

<p>“Will you not see the other Princesses
too?” asked Lubin. “Let them decide between
them whether I am to live or die!”</p>

<p>The King was just going to call for them,
when suddenly the ten Princesses opened
the door of their chamber, and stood before
him shining like stars, with all their golden
hair running down to their feet.</p>

<p>“Now put me to death!” said Lubin;
and all the time he kept his eye upon the
Princess Royal, who turned flame-coloured
with rage.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” cried the King. “Now
you must be more than pardoned! You
see, my dears,” he said to Lyneth and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Princess Royal, “though you have suffered,
your sisters have recovered all that they
lost. They are ten to two; and I can’t go
back on arithmetic; I am bound to do
even more than pardon him for this.”</p>

<p>“Indeed and indeed yes!” replied the
Princess Lyneth. “He has done ten times
more than we thought of asking him!”
And she went from one to another of her
recovered sisters, kissing their beautiful
long hair for pure gladness of heart. But
when she came to the Princess Royal, she
kissed her many times, and stooped down
her face upon her shoulder, and cried over
her.</p>

<p>“Tell me now,” said the King to Lubin,
“for you are a very wonderful fellow, how
did it all happen?”</p>

<p>Lubin looked at the Princess Royal;
after all he could not betray a lady’s secret.
“I cannot tell you,” he said; “if I did,
there would be a death in the family.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the King, “however you
may have done it, I own that you have
earned your reward. You have only to
choose now with which of my daughters
you will become my son-in-law. From this
day you shall be known as my heir.” He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
ranged all the Princesses in line, according
to their ages. “Now choose,” said the
King, “and choose well!”</p>

<p>Lubin went up to the Princess Royal.
“I won’t have you!” he said, looking very
hard at her; and the Princess Royal dropped
her eyes. Then he went on to the next.
“Sweet lady,” he said, “I dare not ask
one with such beautiful hair as yours to
marry me, who am a poor cobbler’s son.”
But all the while he had the Princess
Lyneth’s hair bound round his heart.</p>

<p>He went on from one to another, and of
each he kissed the hand, saying that she
was too fair to marry him.</p>

<p>He came to Lyneth, and knelt down at
her feet. “Lyneth,” he said, “will you
give the poor cobbler back his shoe?”</p>

<p>Lyneth, looking in his eyes, saw all that
he meant. “And myself in it,” she said,
“for you love me dearly!” She put her
arms round his neck, and whispered, “You
marry me because I am a fright, and have
no hair!”</p>

<p>But Lubin said, “I have your hair all
wound round my heart, making it warm!”</p>

<p>So they were married, and lived together
more happily than cobbler and princess ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
lived in the world before. And the cobbler
dropped mending shoes: only his wife’s
shoes he always mended. Very soon Lyneth’s
hair grew again, more shining and beautiful
than before; but the Princess Royal remained
pale, and thin, and was bald to the
day of her death.</p>

<h3>THE MOON-FLOWER</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-p.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Princess Berenice sat
by a window of her father’s
palace, looking out of the
Moon. In her hand she
held a great white pearl,
and smiled, for it was her
mother’s birthday gift. The chamber in
which she sat was of pure silver, and in the
floor was a small window by which she
could see out of the Moon and right down
on to the Earth, where the moonbeams were
going. There it lay like a great green
emerald; and wherever the clouds parted
to let the moonbeams go through, she
could see the tops of the trees, and broad
fields with streams running by.</p>

<p>“Yonder is the land of the coloured
stones,” she said to herself, “that the merchants
go down the moonbeams and bring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
home and sell.” And as she bent lower
and lower and gazed with curious eyes, the
great pearl rolled from her hand and fell
out of the Moon, and went slipping and
sliding down a moonbeam, never stopping
till it got to the Earth.</p>

<p>“My mother’s pearl!” cried the Princess,
“the most beautiful of all her pearls
that she gave me. I must run down and
bring it back; for if I wait it will be lost.
And as to-night is the full-moon down
there upon Earth, I can return before anyone
finds out that I am gone.”</p>

<p>The Earth was sparkling a brighter green
under the approach of night. “Oh, land
of the coloured stones!” cried the Princess;
and, slipping through the window, she
stepped out of the Moon, and went running
down the same moonbeam by which the
pearl had fallen.</p>

<p>Night came; and the Earth and the
Moon lay looking at each other in the
midst of heaven, like an emerald and a
pearl; but through the palace, and within,
over all its gardens and terraces there began
to be callings on the Princess Berenice;
and presently there were heart-searchings
and fear, for they found the empty room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
with its open window: and the Princess
Berenice was not there.</p>

<p>Now, not long before this, upon our own
Earth there had lived and died a King who
had four sons, but only three kingdoms.
So when he came to die he gave to each of
his three eldest sons a kingdom apiece;
but to the youngest, having nothing else left
to give, he gave only a pair of travelling
shoes, and said: “Wear these, and some day
they will take you to fortune!”</p>

<p>So, when the King was dead, the young
Prince wore the shoes night and day, hoping
that some time or another they would take
him to fortune. His brothers laughed at
him, and said: “Our father was wise to
play those old shoes off upon you! If it
had been either of us we would have gone
and bought ourselves an army and fought
for a just share in the inheritance. But
you seem pleased, so we ought to be.”</p>

<p>Now one day the Prince went out hunting
in the forest, and there, having become
separated from all his friends, he thoroughly
lost his way. Wherever he turned the
wood seemed to grow denser, the thickets
higher, and the solitude more than he ever
remembered before. Night came on, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
there being nothing else that he could do,
he lay down and wrapped himself in his
cloak and slept.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was day, but the
woods were as still as death; no bird sang,
and not a cricket chirped among the grass.
As he sat up he noticed that the shoe was
gone from his left foot, nor could he see it
anywhere near. “Tis the half of my inheritance
gone!” he said to himself, and
got up to search about him. But still no
shoe could he find. At last he gave up the
search as useless, and set off walking without
it. Then as it seemed to him so ridiculous
to go limping along with only one shoe on,
he took off the remaining one, and threw
it away, saying: “Go, stupid, and find your
fellow!”</p>

<p>To the Prince’s great astonishment, it set
off at a rapid pace through the wood, all
of its own accord. The Prince, barefoot
except for his stockings, began to run
after it.</p>

<p>Presently he found that he was losing his
breath. “Hie, hie!” he called out, “not
quite so fast, little leather-skins!” But
the shoe paid him no heed and went on as
before. It skipped through the grass and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
brushwood, as if a young girl’s foot were
dancing inside it; and whenever it came to
a fallen tree, or a boulder of rock, it was up
and over with a jump like a grasshopper.</p>

<p>Before long the Prince’s stockings were
in nothing but holes and tatters; as he ran
they fluttered from his legs like ribbons.
He had lost his hat, and his cloak was torn
into patterns, and he felt from head to foot
like a house all doors and windows. He
was almost on his last gasp when he saw
that the shoe was making straight for a
strange little house of green bronze, shut
in by a high wall, and showing no windows;
and in the middle of the wall was a bronze
door shut fast. As he came near he found
that outside, on the doorstep, stood his other
shoe as if waiting to be let in. “So it was
worth running for!” thought he; and then,
putting on both shoes again, he began
knocking at the door.</p>

<p>As he knocked the door opened. It
opened in such a curious way, flat down
like a swing-bridge or like the lid of a box.
For some time he was half afraid to walk in
on the top of it. Presently, however, he
summoned up his courage and stepped
across it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>The door closed behind him like a trap,
and he found himself in a beautiful house;
all its walls were hung with gold and precious
stones, but everywhere was the emptiness
and the silence of death.</p>

<p>He went from room to room seeking for
any that lived there, but could see no one.
In one place he found thrown down a fan
of white feathers and pearl; and in another
flowers, fresh plucked, lying close by a
cushion dinted and hollowed, as though the
weight of a head or arm had rested there.
But beyond these there was no sign of a
living thing to be found.</p>

<p>Through the windows he saw deep
bowery gardens hemmed in by high walls,
within which grew flowers of the loveliest
kinds. All the paths were of smooth grass,
and everywhere were the traces of gentle
handiwork; but still not a soul was to be
seen.</p>

<p>It seemed to the Prince now and then
that there was something in the garden
which moved, distinct from the flowers, and
shifting with a will of its own. Though
the sun shone full down, casting clear
shadows across the lawns, this that he saw
was altogether misty and faint. Now it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
seemed like a feather blown to and fro in
the wind, and now like broken gossamer
threads, or like filmy edges of clouds melting
away in the heat. Where it went the
flowers moved as though to make way for
it, swaying apart and falling together again
as it passed.</p>

<p>The Prince watched and watched. He
tired his eyes with watching, yet he could
see no more; and no way could he find to
the garden, for all the doors leading to it
were locked fast and barred.</p>

<p>There was another strange thing he
noticed which seemed to him to have no
meaning. All over the garden, between
the trees and the sky, was stretched a silver
net, so fine that it showed only as a faint
film against the blue; but a net for all
that. Here and there, the light of the sun
catching it, hung sparkling in its silver
meshes. It was like the net that a gardener
throws over strawberry beds or currant
bushes to keep off the birds from the fruit.
So was it with this net; through it no bird
could enter the garden, and no bird that
was in the garden could leave it.</p>

<p>All day the Prince had these two things
before his eyes to wonder about, till the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
sun went down and it began to get
dusk.</p>

<p>At the moment when the sun sank below
the earth there was a sound of opening doors
all over the house. The Prince ran and
found one of the doors leading into the
garden wide open, and through it he could
see the stir of leaves, and the deep colours
of the flowers growing deeper in the dusk;
only the evening primroses were lighting
their soft lamps.</p>

<p>From a distant part of the garden came
the sound of falling water, and a voice
singing. As he approached he saw something
shining against the dark leaves higher
than the heads of the flowers; and before
he well knew what he saw, he found before
his eyes the most lovely woman that the
mind of man could believe in.</p>

<p>In her hand hung a watering-can, with
the water falling from it in sprays on to the
flower beds beneath. Her head was bent
far down, yet how she looked slender and
tall! She was very pale, yet a soft light
seemed to grow from her, the light of a
new moon upon a twilight sky. And now
the Prince heard clearly the sweet voice,
and the words that she was singing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Listen, listen, listen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">O heart of the sea!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am the Pearl of pearls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am the Mother of pearls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the Mother of thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glisten, glisten, glisten,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">O bed of the sea!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lost is the Pearl of pearls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the divers for pearls</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Are drowning for me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He stood enchanted to hear her; but the
words of the song ended suddenly in a deep
sigh. The singer lifted her head; her eyes
moved like grey moths in the dusk, amid
the whiteness of her face. At sight of him
they grew still and large, widening with a
quiet wonder. Then the beautiful face
broke into smiles, and the Princess stretched
out her hands to him and laughed.</p>

<p>“Have you come,” she said, “to set me
free?”</p>

<p>“To set you free?” asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“I am a prisoner,” she told him.</p>

<p>“Alas, then!” answered the Prince, “I
am a prisoner also, and can free no one;
but were I now free to go wherever I
would, I should be a prisoner still, for I
have seen the face of the loveliest heart
on earth!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“O,” she sighed, “and can you not set
me free?”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, “what makes you a
prisoner here?”</p>

<p>She pointed to the net over their heads,
to the walls that stood on all sides of them,
and to the ground beneath their feet.
“That,” she said, “and that, and this.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked, “and where
do you come from? and whose power is it
that now holds you captive?”</p>

<p>She led him on to a terrace, from which
they could see out towards the west; and
there lay the new Moon, low down in the
sky. “Yonder,” she said, pointing to it,
“is my home!” She wept. “Shall I ever
return to it?”</p>

<p>The Prince, gazing at her in wonder,
cried, “Are you one of a Fairy race?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no!” she sighed, “I am but
mortal like yourself; only my home is
there, while yours is here. We, who dwell
in the Moon, are as you are, but the sun
has greater power over us; the light of it
falling on us makes us pale and unsubstantial,
so that we weigh not so much as a
gossamer and become transparent as thin
fleeces of cloud. Then we can go where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
you cannot go, treading the light as it
flies; but at sunset we regain our strength,
and our bodies come to us again; and we
are as you see me now—no different from
yourselves, the inhabitants of the Earth.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said the Prince, “of yourself,
and the dwellers in the Moon! Is it not
cold there, and barren?”</p>

<p>She answered smiling, for the memory of
her home was sweet to her, “Outside, the
Moon is cold and barren; but within it is
very warm and rich and fertile; more
beautiful than any place I have seen on
Earth. It is there we live; and we have
flocks, and herds, and woods, and rivers, and
harbours, and seas. Also we have great
cities built inside the Moon’s crust, for the
Moon is a great hollow shell, and we walk
upon its inner surface and are warm. The
sunlight comes to us through craters and
clefts in the ground; and the beams of it
are like solid pillars of gold that quiver
and sway as they shoot upwards into the
opal twilight of our world; and the shine
and the warmth of it come to us, and colour
the air above our heads; but we are safe
from its full light falling on us, for the
ground is between us and it. Only when we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
pass through to the outer side do we become
pale and faint, a mere whisper of our former
selves. And then we are so light that if
we step upon a moonbeam it will bear
our weight; and the moonbeam carries us
swiftly as its own light travels, till it reaches
the Earth: so we come. But to return there
is another way.”</p>

<p>And when the Prince asked her, she told
him of the other way back into the Moon.</p>

<p>“When we wish to return,” she went on
“(for the falling light of a moonbeam cannot
carry us back), we must go where there is a
pool of still water, and wait for the reflection
of the Moon to fall on it; and when
the Moon is full, and throws its image into
the water, then we dive down, and with our
lips touch the reflection of its face, crying,
‘Open, open to me, for I am a Moon-child!’
And the Moon will open her face
like a door of pearl, and let us pass in;
and when she draws her reflection out of
the pool, we find ourselves once again
among our own people and in our own land.
Many of us have so come and so returned,”
she sighed deeply, “but I fear that I shall
never again return.”</p>

<p>Then the Prince asked her further whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
power it was that held her captive; and she
told him how she had dropped the pearl
that her mother had given her, and had
come down seeking it. Then she said, “In
the Moon we have many jewels, for we have
opals and onyxes, and pearls and moonstones,
but we have no rubies, or emeralds, or
sapphires, or stones of a single colour, such
as you have. Therefore, we have a passion for
these things, and our merchants come down
and bring them back to us at a great price.</p>

<p>“Now it chanced that in my search I
came upon a gnome who had dealings with
our merchants and had many jewels to sell,
and he, seeming to be kind, helped me until
my pearl was found. Then he took me to
see his own treasures, and, alas, while my
eyes were feasting on the colours of the
stones he showed to me, my poor beauty
inflamed the avarice of his evil heart, and
the desire to have me for his wife became
great. So when I asked him the price of
his jewels, he vowed that the only price at
which he would let them go was that of my
own hand in marriage. Alas, I am young
and innocent, and without subtlety, nor
did I know how great was his power and
wickedness. As I laughed at his request his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
face grew dark with rage, and I saw that I
had incurred the undying enmity of his
cruel heart. And now for a whole year he
has held me in his enchantment, striving to
break me to his will by the length and
weariness of my captivity; and lest search
or any help should come for me from my
father’s people, he has covered me in with
a net, and surrounded me with walls; and
here there is no pool into which the full
Moon may fall, and at the mere touch of
my lips upon its face, open and draw me
free from my enchantment, and back into
the heart of my own land. Only yonder,
in the corner of the garden is a deep well,
where the Moon never shines; so there is
no way here left for me by which I may
get free.”</p>

<p>“Does not the gnome ever come to see
you in your captivity?” asked the Prince.
“If so, I may by some means be able to
entrap him, and force him to let you go.”</p>

<p>“Twice in the year he has visited me,”
answered the Princess. “He comes up out
of the ground in the form of a Red Mole;
but he looks at me wickedly and cunningly
with the eyes of a man, seeming to say,
‘Will you have me yet?’ And when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
shake my head he burrows under again,
and is gone till another six months shall be
past.”</p>

<p>The Prince thought for a while and said,
“I do not know whether I have the power
or the wit to make you free; if love only
were needed for the work, to-morrow would
see you as free as a bird.”</p>

<p>The Princess, between smiles and sighs,
said, “I have been most lonely here; already
you make my imprisonment seem less.”
Then she led him within doors, from room
to room, showing him the splendours of
her prison. Wherever they went, out of
the floor before them rose burning jewels
that hung hovering over their heads to
light them as they passed; and when she
struck her hands together, up from the
ground rose a table covered with fruit and
dainties of all sorts; and when she and the
Prince had eaten, she clapped her hands
again, and they disappeared by the same
way that they had come.</p>

<p>The Prince was struck with admiration
at the delicacy of these marvels. “When
I think of the Red Mole, they sicken me!”
said the Moon-Princess. The good youth
used all his arts to cheer her, promising to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
devote himself, and if need be his life, to
the task of setting her free. And now and
then she laughed and was almost merry
again, forgetting the walls that still held
her spell-bound from her own people and
her own land.</p>

<p>She showed the Prince a chamber where
he might sleep; and so soft and warm was
the couch after his last hard night on
the ground, that it was full day before he
awoke. The Princess Berenice appeared
before him misty and faint, for the sunlight
threw a veil upon her beauty; but still as he
looked at her he did not love her less, and
it still seemed to him that hers was the face
of the loveliest heart on earth.</p>

<p>All day he watched her drifting about
the garden, seeming to feed herself on the
scent of the flowers. In the evening, when
the sun set, her body grew strong and her
face shone out to him like the new Moon
upon a twilight sky.</p>

<p>Then he drew water for her from the
well, and watched her as she watered the
flowers which were her only delight. Presently
he said, “There is much water in the
well, for the rope goes down into it many
fathoms; and yet I find no bottom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Princess, “I doubt
not that the well is deep.”</p>

<p>“Before many days are over,” said the
Prince, “the well shall become a pool.”</p>

<p>The Princess wondered to hear him. “Is
there,” he went on, “no such thing as a
spade for me to dig with?” Then she led
him to a shed, where lay all the needed
implements for gardening. So his eyes
brightened, while he cried, “O, beautiful
Princess Berenice, as I love you, before
many weeks are over you shall be free!”</p>

<p>The next morning he arose very early,
and in the centre of the garden, where the
ground hollowed somewhat, he marked out
a space and set to work to dig.</p>

<p>All day the Princess went to and fro,
faint and pale as a mist, watching him at
his work. At dusk her beauty shone full
upon him, and she said, “What is this that
you are doing?” He answered, “What I
am making shall presently become a pool;
then when the pool is full, and the full
Moon comes and shines on it, you shall go
down into the water, and shall kiss the face
of its reflection with your lips, and be free
from your enchantment.”</p>

<p>Princess Berenice looked long at him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and her eyes clung to his like soft moths in
the gloom. “But you?” she said, “You
are no Moon-child, and this will never set
you free.”</p>

<p>“Ever since I saw you,” said the Prince,
“I have not thought of freedom; my
dearest wish is but to set you free.”</p>

<p>The Princess gave him her hand. “And
mine,” she said, “my dearest wish henceforth
is to set you free also. Yet I know
but one way, and I cannot name it.” She
smiled tenderly on him, and bowed her face
into the shadow of her hair.</p>

<p>The Prince caught her in his arms, “One
way is my way!” he cried. “Your way,”
she said, “is my way.” Then, when he
had finished kissing her, she said, “Look, on
my finger is a ring; this ring is for him to
whom I give myself in marriage. Surely,
it opens to him the heart of my own people,
and he becomes one of us, a child of the
Moon.” She showed him an opal ring, full
of fires. “If your way is my way,” she
said, “draw this off my finger, and put it
upon your own, and take me to be your
wife!”</p>

<p>So the Prince drew off the ring from her
finger, and set it upon his own; and as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
did so he felt indeed the heart of the Moon-people
become his own, and the love of the
Moon strike root in him. Yet did the love
of the Earth remain his as well, making it
seem as if all the love in his heart had
but doubled itself.</p>

<p>So he and the most beautiful Berenice
were married there by the light of the new
Moon, and all thought of sorrow or danger
from the encirclement that bound them was
lost in their great joy.</p>

<p>During the whole of the next day the
Prince went on with his digging, making a
broad shallow in the ground. “Before the
full Moon comes,” he said, “I will make it
deep.” And he worked on, refusing to take
any rest.</p>

<p>The Princess loved him more and more as
she watched him; and his love for her daily
increased, for every day, while the Moon
grew full, her beauty shone in greater perfection
and splendour. “Here,” she said
to him, “the coming of the full Moon is
like the coming of Spring to me: I feel it
in my blood. After the full Moon my
beauty will wane and grow paler. But in
my own land I do not feel these changes,
for there it is always the full Moon.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
Prince answered her, “To me your beauty,
though it grows more, will not ever grow
less.”</p>

<p>At last, on the day before that of the full
Moon, the pit which he had dug was broad
and deep; then he began to fill it with
water from the well. “To-morrow,” he
said to his wife, when the pool was nearly
full, as she came and stood by his side at
sunset in the full blaze of her beauty, “to-morrow
we shall be free; and you will carry
me away with you into your own land.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the Princess, “I
begin to be afraid!” and she sighed heavily.
“Any day the Red Mole may come: one
day is not too soon for him to be here.”</p>

<p>“But why need you fear him now?”
asked the Prince. “Since you are married
to me, you cannot be married to him.”</p>

<p>“As to that,” said she, “I fear that to have
outwitted him will but make his malice all
the greater against us!” Then she walked
softly among the moonbeams, bathing her
hands in them, and letting them fall upon
the loveliness of her face; and as she stood
in their light, tears rained down out of her
eyes.</p>

<p>In the morning it seemed as if her happiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
had returned. The Prince, as he toiled
under the blazing sun, carrying water from
the well to the pool, felt her moving by his
side, and heard her light shadowy laughter
when, just before sunset, the water flowed
level to the pool’s brink. And when dusk
rose out of the grass, there she stood glowing
with the full Moon of her beauty, and
leaning in all the light of her loveliness
towards him.</p>

<p>The happy night drew round them;
out of the East came the glow of the full
Moon as it rose; soon, soon it would cross
the tops of the trees and rest its face upon
the quiet waters of the pool. They clung
in each other’s arms, entranced. “My
beautiful,” said the Prince, “shall we not
take to your mother some of those jewels
she loves—the green, and the red, and the
blue, and the pearl which was hers, the
quest of which has cost you so much?” He
ran into one of the jewelled chambers where
lay the pearl, and caught from the walls the
largest stones he could find. Quickly he
went and returned, for the Moon was now
fast cresting the avenues of the garden. He
came bearing the jewels in his hands.</p>

<p>Princess Berenice stood no longer by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
brink of the pool, though therein lay the
image of the Moon’s face, a circle of pale
gold upon the water. “Berenice,” called
the Prince, and ran through the garden,
searching for her. “Berenice!” he cried
by the well; but she was not there. “Berenice!”
His voice grew trembling and weak,
and quick fear took hold of him. “O, my
beautiful, my beloved, where are you?”</p>

<p>Only the silence stood up to answer him.
Under his feet ran a Red Mole.</p>

<p>It scampered across the grass, and disappeared
through a burrow in the ground.
Then the Prince knew that the worst had
surely come, and that his Princess had been
taken away from him. Where she was he
could not know; within her former prison
she was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>All night the Prince lay weeping by the
brink of the pool, where she had last stood
before his sight; the print of her dear feet
still lay on the lawn where she had stayed
waiting with him so long. “O, miserable
wretch that I am!” he cried, kissing the
trodden grass. “Now never again may I
hope to behold you, or hear your dear
voice!”</p>

<p>All the day following he wandered like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
ghost from place to place, filling the empty
garden with memories of her presence, and
sighing over and over again the music of
her name. All the flowers glowed round
him in their accustomed beauty; new buds
came into life, and full blooms broke and
fell; not a thing seemed to sorrow for her
loss except himself. As for the flowers, he
paid them little heed.</p>

<p>In his sleep that night a dream came to
him, a dream as of something that whispered
and laughed in his ear. Over and over
again it seemed to be saying, “The Red
Mole came, and the full Moon came, and
the Princess jumped down into the water!”
Then his heart knocked so loud for joy
that he started awake, and saw the Red
Mole scuffling away to its burrow in the
ground.</p>

<p>Then he feared that the dream was but a
thing devised to cheat his fancy, and get rid
of him by making him go away and search
for his Princess in the land of the Moon, by
the way that she had told him. But he
thought to himself, “If the Red Mole wants
so much to get me away, it means that my
beloved is somewhere near at hand. Is she
in the well?” he began wondering; and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
soon as it was light he went to where lay
the well in its corner under the shadow of
the wall. But though he searched long and
diligently, there was no trace of her that he
could find.</p>

<p>Yet every time he came near to the well
sorrow seemed to take hold of him, and,
mixed with it, a kind of joy, as though
indeed the heart of his beloved beat in this
place. Near to the well stood a tall flower
with bowed head. It seemed to him the
only one in the whole garden that had any
share in his sorrow: he wondered if the
flower had grown up to mark the sad place
of her burial.</p>

<p>“O, my beloved Berenice, art thou near
me now?” he murmured, heart-broken, one
day as he passed by: then it seemed to him
that all at once the flower stirred. He turned
to look at it; it was like a sunflower, but
white even to its centre, and its head kept
drooping as if for pure grief. “Berenice,
Berenice!” he wept, passing it.</p>

<p>At dusk he returned again; and now the
flower’s head was lifted up, and shone with
a strange lustre. The Prince, as he went
by on his way to the well, saw the flower
turn its head, bending its face ever towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
where he was. Then grief and joy stirred
in his heart. “The flower knows where
she is!” he said.</p>

<p>So he bent, whispering, “Where, then, is
Berenice?” and the flower lifted its head,
and hung quite still, looking at him.</p>

<p>Then the Prince whispered again, “The
Red Mole came, and the full Moon came,
and the Princess jumped down into the
water?”</p>

<p>But the flower swayed its head from side
to side, and the Prince found that it had
answered “No.”</p>

<p>Then he had it in his mind to ask of it
further things; but, as he was about to
speak, he beheld its face all brimming over
with tears, that suddenly broke and fell
down in a shower over its leaves.</p>

<p>At that his heart leaped, and his voice
choked as he cried, “Art <i>thou</i> my beloved,
my Berenice?” And all at once the flower
swayed down, and leaned, and fell weeping
against his breast.</p>

<p>So at last he knew! And joy and grief
struggled together in him for mastery.</p>

<p>All that night he knelt with the flower’s
head upon his heart, stroking its soft
leaves, and letting it rest between his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
hands; till, towards dawn, it seemed to him
that peace was upon it and sleep.</p>

<p>All through the day it hung faint upon
its stem; but when evening came it lifted
its head and shone in moon-like beauty;
and so deep for it was the Prince’s love and
compassion that he could hardly bear to be
absent from its side one moment of the
day or night.</p>

<p>And, when he was very weary, he lay down
under its shadow to sleep; and the Moon-flower
bent down and rested its head upon
his face.</p>

<p>All night long in dreams Berenice came
back to him. He seemed to hear how the
Red Mole had come, and changed her to a
rooted shape, lest the full Moon in the water
should carry her away from him back into
her own land. Yet it was only a dream,
and the Prince could learn nothing there of
the way by which he might set her free.</p>

<p>A month went by, and he said to his
Flower, “To-night is the night of the full
Moon: now, if I drew you from the ground,
and carried you down, and called for the
Moon’s face to open to us, would you not
be free from the enchantment, when you
were come again to your own people?” But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the Moon-flower shook its head, as if to
bid him still wait and watch patiently.</p>

<p>Now, as the Prince came and went day by
day, he began to notice that the Moon-flower
had its roots in a small green mound, no
bigger than a mole-hill; and he thought to
himself, “surely that mound was not there
at first: the Red Mole must be down below
at work!” So he watched it from day to
day; and at last he knew for certain that,
as time went on, the mound grew larger.</p>

<p>Month by month the mound upon which
the Moon-flower had root increased in size;
yet the Flower thrived, and its beauty shone
brighter as each full Moon approached, so
that at last the Prince’s fear lest the Red
Mole were working mischief against its life,
passed away.</p>

<p>Once, on the night of a full Moon, as the
Prince lay with his head upon Earth, and
the Moon-flower bowed over his face, he
heard under the mound a peal of silvery
laughter; and at the sound of it the Moon-flower
started, and stood erect, and a stir of
delight seemed to take hold of its leaves.
Again the laughter came, and the soft earth
moved at the sound of it.</p>

<p>The Prince started up, and ran and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
fetched a spade, and struck it down under
the loose soil of the mound. When he
lifted up the earth, out sprang a tiny child
like a lobe of quicksilver, laughing merrily
with its first leap into the light. But even
then its laughter changed into a cry; for
out after it darted the Red Mole, with fury
in its whiskers, and wrath flashing out of
its eyes.</p>

<p>The quicksilver child sprang away, and
went shrilling over the grass toward the
margin of the pool. There lay the full
Moon’s image upon the clear stillness of the
water; and the child leapt down the bank,
and laughed as it sprang safely away. Then
there followed a tiny splash; and the Prince,
amid the rings upon the water’s surface,
saw, like a door of pearl, the Moon’s face
open and close again. And the Red Mole
went down into the earth gnashing its teeth
for rage.</p>

<p>The Prince ran back to the Moon-flower,
and found it bent forwards and
trembling with fear. Then he drew its
head towards his heart, and whispered
“The Red Mole came, and the full Moon
came, and the silver child jumped down
into the water!” And at that the Flower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
lifted its head and began clapping its leaves
for joy.</p>

<p>A month went by, and the green mound
had disappeared from beneath the Moon-flower’s
roots; and still every night the
Prince lay down under the shadow of its
leaves; and the Flower bent over him, and
laid its head against his face.</p>

<p>As he lay so, one night, and watched the
full Moon travelling high overhead, he saw
a shadow begin to cross over it; and he
knew that it was the eclipse, which is the
shadow of the Earth passing over the face
of the Moon; then he rose softly, leaving
the Moon-flower asleep, and went and stood
by the brink of the pool.</p>

<p>Up in the Moon the silver child felt the
shadow of the Earth fall upon the face of
the Moon; and he came and touched the
Earth’s shadow with his lips, crying, “Open,
open to me, for I am an Earth-child!”
Then the Earth’s shadow that was upon the
Moon opened, and the silver child sprang
through.</p>

<p>The Prince, watching the veiled image of
the Moon’s face in the water, saw the
Earth’s shadow open like a door, so that
for an instant the brightness of the Moon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
shone through, and out sprang the quicksilver
child, up to the surface of the pool.</p>

<p>He leapt laughing up the bank, and went
running over the grass to where the Moon-flower
was standing. He reached up his
arms, and caught the Flower by the head:</p>

<p>“O mother, mother, mother!” he cried
as he kissed it.</p>

<p>And at the touch of his lips the Moon-flower
opened and changed, growing wondrously
tall and fair; and the flower turned
into a face, and the leaves disappeared, till
it was the beautiful Princess Berenice herself,
who stooped down and took the quicksilver
child up into her arms.</p>

<p>She cried, fondling him, “Did they give
you your name?”</p>

<p>And the child laughed. “They call me
Gammelyn,” he said.</p>

<p>The Prince caught them both together in
his arms. “Come, come!” he shouted and
laughed, “for yonder is the full Moon
waiting for us!” And, lifting them up, he
ran with them to the borders of the pool.</p>

<p>And the Red Mole came, and the full
Moon came; and the Prince, and the
Princess, and the silver child jumped down
into the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>Then the Prince laid his lips against the
reflection of the Earth’s shadow, crying,
“Open, open to me, for I am a child of the
Earth!” And the shadow opened like a
door to let them pass through. Then they
pressed their lips against the reflection of
the Moon’s face crying, “Open, open to us,
for we are Moon-children!” And the
Moon opened her face like a door of pearl,
so that they sprang through together, and
were safe.</p>

<p>And when the Moon drew its reflection
out of the pool, they found themselves in
the land of the Moon, in the silver chamber
with the round window, in the palace of
Princess Berenice’s father.</p>

<p>Looking out through the window, down
at the end of a long moonbeam they saw
the Red Mole gnashing his whiskers for
rage. Then the Prince took off his shoes,
and threw them with all his might down
the moonbeam at the Mole.</p>

<p>As the shoes fell, they went faster, and
faster, and faster, till they came to
earth; and they struck the Mole so hard
upon the head that he died.</p>

<p>Now as for Gammelyn and the shoes we
may hear of them again elsewhere; but as for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the Prince and his beautiful Princess
Berenice, the happiness in which they
lived for the rest of their days is too great
even to be told of.</p>

<h3>HAPPY RETURNS</h3>

<div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">By the side of a great river,
whose stream formed the
boundary to two countries,
lived an old ferryman and
his wife. All the day, while
she minded the house, he
sat in his boat by the ferry, waiting to carry
travellers across; or, when no travellers
came, and he had his boat free, he would
cast drag-nets along the bed of the river for
fish. But for the food which he was able
thus to procure at times, he and his wife
might well have starved, for travellers were
often few and far between, and often they
grudged him the few pence he asked for
ferrying them; and now he had grown
so old and feeble that when the river was
in flood he could scarcely ferry the boat
across; and continually he feared lest a
younger and stronger man should come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and take his place, and the bread from his
mouth.</p>

<p>But he had trust in Providence. “Will
not God,” he said, “who has given us no
happiness in this life, save in each other’s
help and companionship, allow us to end
our days in peace?”</p>

<p>And his wife answered, “Yes, surely, if
we trust Him enough He will.”</p>

<p>One morning, it being the first day of
the year, the ferryman going down to his
boat, found that during the night it had
been loosed from its moorings and taken
across the river, where it now lay fastened
to the further bank.</p>

<p>“Wife,” said he, “I can remember this
same thing happening a year ago, and the
year before also. Who is this traveller who
comes once a year, like a thief in the night,
and crosses without asking me to ferry him
over?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is the good folk,” said his
wife. “Go over and see if they have left
no coin behind them in the boat.”</p>

<p>The old man got on to a log and poled
himself across, and found, down in the
keel of the boat, the mark of a man’s bare
foot driven deep into the wood; but there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
was no coin or other trace to show who it
might be.</p>

<p>Time went on; the old ferryman was all
bowed down with age, and his body was
racked with pains. So slow was he now in
making the passage of the stream, that all
travellers who knew those parts took a road
higher up the bank, where a stronger ferryman
plied.</p>

<p>Winter came; and hunger and want
pressed hard at the old man’s door. One
day while he drew his net along the stream,
he felt the shock of a great fish striking
against the meshes down below, and presently,
as the net came in, he saw a shape
like living silver, leaping and darting to
and fro to find some way of escape. Up
to the bank he landed it, a great gasping
fish.</p>

<p>When he was about to kill it, he saw, to
his astonishment, tears running out of its
eyes, that gazed at him and seemed to reproach
him for his cruelty. As he drew
back, the Fish said: “Why should you kill
me, who wish to live?”</p>

<p>The old man, altogether bewildered at
hearing himself thus addressed, answered:
“Since I and my wife are hungry, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
God gave you to be eaten, I have good
reason for killing you.”</p>

<p>“I could give you something worth
far more than a meal,” said the Fish, “if
you would spare my life.”</p>

<p>“We are old,” said the ferryman, “and
want only to end our days in peace. To-day
we are hungry; what can be more
good for us than a meal which will give us
strength for the morrow, which is the new
year?”</p>

<p>The Fish said: “To-night some one will
come and unfasten your boat, and ferry
himself over, and you know nothing of it
till the morning, when you see the craft
moored out yonder by the further bank.”</p>

<p>The old man remembered how the thing
had happened in previous years, directly
the Fish spoke. “Ah, you know that then!
How is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“When you go back to your hut at night
to sleep, I am here in the water,” said the
Fish. “I see what goes on.”</p>

<p>“What goes on, then?” asked the old
man, very curious to know who the strange
traveller might be.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the Fish, “if you could only
catch him in your boat, he could give you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
something you might wish for! I tell you
this: do you and your wife keep watch in
the boat all night, and when he comes, and
you have ferried him into mid-stream,
where he cannot escape, then throw your
net over him and hold him till he pays you
for all your ferryings.”</p>

<p>“How shall he pay me? All my ferryings
of a lifetime!”</p>

<p>“Make him take you to the land of
Returning Time. There, at least, you can
end your days in peace.”</p>

<p>The old man said: “You have told me
a strange thing; and since I mean to act on
it, I suppose I must let you go. If you
have deceived me, I trust you may yet die
a cruel death.”</p>

<p>The Fish answered: “Do as I tell you,
and you shall die a happy one.” And,
saying this, he slipped down into the water
and disappeared.</p>

<p>The ferryman went back to his wife
supperless, and said to her: “Wife, bring a
net, and come down into the boat!” And
he told her the story of the Fish and of the
yearly traveller.</p>

<p>They sat long together under the dark
bank, looking out over the quiet and cold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
moonlit waters, till the midnight hour.
The air was chill, and to keep themselves
warm they covered themselves over with the
net and lay down in the bottom of the boat.
It was the very hour when the old year dies
and the new year is born.</p>

<p>Before they well knew that they had been
asleep, they started to feel the rocking of
the boat, and found themselves out upon
the broad waters of the river. And there in
the fore-part of the boat, clear and sparkling
in the moonlight, stood a naked man of
shining silver. He was bending upon the
pole of the boat, and his long hair fell over
it right down into the water.</p>

<p>The old couple rose up quietly, and unwinding
themselves from the net, threw it
over the Silver Man, over his head and
hands and feet, and dragged him down into
the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>The old man caught the ferry pole, and
heaved the boat still into the middle of the
stream. As he did so a gentle shock came
to the heart of each; feebly it fluttered and
sank low. “Oh, wife!” sighed the old
man, and reached out his hand for hers.</p>

<p>The Silver Man lay still in the folds of
the net, and looked at them with a wise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
and quiet gaze. “What would you have
of me?” he said, and his voice was far off
and low.</p>

<p>They said, “Bring us into the land of
Returning Time.”</p>

<p>The Silver Man said: “Only once can
you go there, and once return.”</p>

<p>They both answered “We wish once to
go there, and once return.”</p>

<p>So he promised them that they should
have the whole of their request; and they
unloosed him from the net, and landed all
together on the further bank.</p>

<p>Up the hill they went, following the
track of the Silver Man. Presently they
reached its crest; and there before them
lay all the howling winter of the world.</p>

<p>The Silver Man turned his face and
looked back; and looking back it became
all young, and ruddy, and bright. The
ferryman and his wife gazed at him, both
speechless at the wonderful change. He
took their hands, making them turn the
way by which they had come; below their
feet was a deep black gulf, and beyond and
away lay nothing but a dark starless hollow
of air.</p>

<p>“Now,” said their guide, “you have but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
to step forward one step, and you shall be
in the land of Returning Time.”</p>

<p>They loosed hold of his hands, joined
clasp, husband with wife, and at one step
upon what seemed gulf beneath their feet,
found themselves in a green and flowery
land. There were perfumed valleys and
grassy hills, whose crops stretched down
before the breeze; thick fleecy clouds
crossed their tops, and overhead, amid a blue
air rang the shrill trilling of birds. Behind
lay, fading mistily as a dream, the bare world
they had left; and fast on his forward road,
growing small to them from a distance,
went the Silver Man, a shining point on the
horizon.</p>

<p>The ferryman and his wife looked, and
saw youth in each other’s faces beginning to
peep out through the furrows of age; each
step they took made them grow younger
and stronger; years fell from them like worn-out
rags as they went down into the valleys
of the land of Returning Time.</p>

<p>How fast Time returned! Each step
made the change of a day, and every mile
brought them five years back toward youth.
When they came down to the streams that
ran in the bed of each valley, the ferryman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
and his wife felt their prime return to them.
He saw the gold come back into her locks,
and she the brown into his. Their lips became
open to laughter and song. “Oh,
how good,” they cried, “to have lived all
our lives poor, to come at last to this!”</p>

<p>They drank water out of the streams,
and tasted the fruit from the trees that
grew over them; till presently, being tired
for mere joy, they lay down in the grass
to rest. They slept hand within hand and
cheek against cheek, and, when they woke,
found themselves quite young again, just at
the age when they were first married in the
years gone by.</p>

<p>The ferryman started up and felt the
desire of life strong in his blood. “Come!”
he said to his wife, “or we shall become
too young with lingering here. Now we
have regained our youth, let us go back
into the world once more!”</p>

<p>His wife hung upon his hand, “Are we
not happy enough,” she asked, “as it is?
Why should we return?”</p>

<p>“But,” he cried, “we shall grow too
young; now we have youth and life at its
best let us return! Time goes too fast with
us; we are in danger of it carrying us away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>She said no further word, but followed up
toward the way by which they had entered.
And yet, in spite of her wish to remain, as
she went her young blood frisked. Presently
coming to the top of a hill, they set
off running and racing; at the bottom they
looked at each other, and saw themselves
boy and girl once more.</p>

<p>“We have stayed here too long!” said
the ferryman, and pressed on.</p>

<p>“Oh, the birds,” sighed she, “and the
flowers, and the grassy hills to run on, we
are leaving behind!” But still the boy
had the wish for a man’s life again, and
urged her on; and still with every step
they grew younger and younger. At length,
two small children, they came to the border
of that enchanted land, and saw beyond
the world bleak and wintry and without
leaf. Only a further step was wanted to
bring them face to face once more with the
hard battle of life.</p>

<p>Tears rose in the child-wife’s eyes: “If
we go,” she said, “we can never return!”
Her husband looked long at her wistful face;
he, too, was more of a child now, and was
forgetting his wish to be a man again.</p>

<p>He took hold of her hand and turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
round with her, and together they faced
once more the flowery orchards, and the
happy watered valleys.</p>

<p>Away down there light streams tinkled,
and birds called. Downwards they went,
slowly at first, then with dancing feet, as
with shoutings and laughter they ran.</p>

<p>Down into the level fields they ran; their
running was turned to a toddling; their
toddling to a tumbling; their tumbling to
a slow crawl upon hands and feet among
the high grass and flowers; till at last they
were lying side by side, curled up into a
cuddly ball, chuckling and dimpling and
crowing to the insects and birds that passed
over them.</p>

<p>Then they heard the sweet laughter of
Father Time; and over the hill he came,
young, ruddy, and shining, and gathered
them up sound asleep on the old boat by
the ferry.</p>
