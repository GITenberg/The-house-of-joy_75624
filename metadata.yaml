summary: '"The House of Joy" by Laurence Housman is a collection of fairy tales written
  in the late 19th century. The stories within explore themes of love, sacrifice,
  and transformation, set against a backdrop of magical elements and whimsical characters.
  The opening tale, "The Prince with the Nine Sorrows," features a prince destined
  to encounter profound sadness due to the mysterious disappearance of his foster-sisters,
  intricately entwined with his fate.  The beginning of "The House of Joy" introduces
  readers to the life of a young prince raised far from his royal family, who bears
  nine sorrows linked to the loss of his foster-sisters. After a foreboding dream,
  his mother enlists the help of a family fairy, which ultimately leads to the mysterious
  vanishing of the sisters. As the prince grows, he feels the void of his lost siblings
  and the weight of his melancholy. Driven by an innate desire to find them, he embarks
  on a quest, revealing a heartfelt exploration of familial bonds and the intersection
  of joy and sorrow. The narrative combines elements of fantasy with deep emotional
  resonance, inviting readers into a rich tapestry of enchanting storytelling. (This
